The disruption of pregnancy was prevented by a single, concurrent, subcutaneous injection of progesterone (4 mg/rat). Thus, the interruption of pregnancy occurs via an acute, short-term, reversible progesterone withdrawal. The reduction of progesterone levels is brought about by competitive inhibition of ovarian 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity. Despite its potency as an interceptive agent, azastene exhibited only moderate endocrine-related effects if given daily for 2 weeks to female rats at doses as high as 1000 mg/kg.

Significant suppression of adult mean serum testosterone levels was only observed in male pups exposed to lead continuously from gestational age 5 d throughout life. Lead decreased birth weight in all animals exposed in utero and mean body weights were significantly decreased in all lead-treated groups up to weaning. Analysis of growth curves revealed that all lead-treated groups had significantly reduced growth rates during lactation. However, in addition, in male pups exposed to lead during pregnancy and lactation, from birth or from gestational age 5 d, growth rates were also significantly reduced during puberty. Postpubertal growth rates were unaffected in any lead-treated group. Thus, delayed female reproductive development and suppression of adult male serum testosterone concentration required continuous exposure to the heavy metal. Little evidence was observed for an alteration of \"endocrine imprinting\" by lead on either reproductive or growth parameters.

Lead exposure of dams continued until weaning, following which lead exposure of pups was continued until sacrifice at age 2 , 35, 55, and 85 days. Birth weight and prepubertal and pubertal growth rates were significantly suppressed. Growth rates were suppressed to a much greater degree in male as compared to female pups. Decreased growth rates were accompanied by a significant decrease in plasma insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) concentrations and (1) a significant increase in pituitary growth hormone (GH) content during puberty in pups of both sexes, (2) a delay in the developmental profiles of the GH-dependent male-specific liver enzymes cytochrome P-450 CYP2C11 and N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene sulfotransferase, and (3) continued suppression of these enzymes in lead-exposed adult male pups. In addition, significant decreases in plasma sex steroids, testosterone (male) and 17beta-estradiol (female), were observed during puberty. Postpuberty, at age 85 d, both IGF1 and sex steroid levels were indistinguishable from control pups despite continued lead exposure. Growth rates were also similar in control and lead-exposed pups between age 57 and 85 d. Data suggest that the mechanism underlying lead-induced sex-independent suppression of growth observed in these studies involves disruption of GH secretion during puberty.

DMBA-treatment produced no significant effect on the overall mean values of GnRH mRNA. GnRH mRNA levels in control rats rose significantly between 16.00 and 20.00 h on proestrus and between 18.00 and 20.00 h on diestrus I. DMBA-treated rats had a surge in GnRH mRNA levels at 18.00 h on proestrus, and showed additional surges at 18.00h on diestrus II and estrus. GnRH receptor mRNA content in the anterior pituitary gland surged at 16.00h on certain days of the cycle in both groups of rats. In control rats, only the surge on diestrus II proved significant, whereas DMBA-treated rats exhibited significant surges on diestrus I, diestrus II and proestrus. GnRH receptor mRNA values were significantly lower on both days of diestrus in DMBA-treated rats compared with controls. GnRH Rc peptide content, like GnRH receptor in RNA surged at 16.00h in both groups with the exception of a marked fall on proestrus day for DMBA treated rats. A reduction in the amplitude of the surge was also seen on the day of estrous and to a lesser extend on the day of diestrus DII in DMBA treated animal.

Similarly, such treatment in 7-day-old rats was responsible for a very strong reduction of the subtype 3 mRNA levels in the hypothalamic periventricular nuclei and a strong (p < 0.01) increase of the subtype 3 mRNA levels in the ventromedial nuclei. Moreover, even greater upregulated and downregulated activities were reported when subtype 3 mRNA levels were determined in the presence of receptor agonists specific for distinct alpha GABA(A) receptor subunits (alpha(1,5)). The predominant effects of bisphenol A on somatostatin receptor subtype 3 mRNA levels occurring in an alpha GABA(A) subunit-dependent manner tend to suggest the early modulatory importance of this environmental disruptor on cross-talking mechanisms that are implicated in the plasticity of neural circuits, with consequential influence on neuroendocrine/sociosexual behaviors.", "title": "Neurobiological effects of bisphenol A may be mediated by somatostatin subtype 3 receptors in some regions of the developing rat brain.", "related": ["neurological", "air pollutants", "occupational", "amides", "benzhydryl compounds", "estrogens", "non-steroidal", "indoles", "l 779976", "l796778", "nitrobenzenes", "phenols", "rna", "messenger", "receptors", "gaba-a", "receptors", "somatostatin", "somatostatin receptor 3", "somatostatin", "bisphenol a", "alzheimer\u201a\u00e4\u00f4s disease", "insulin resistance", "kynurenine", "neuroinflammation", "tryptophan", "alzheimer disease", "hiv infections", "humans", "kynurenine", "oxidative stress", "tryptophan", "bisphenol a"]}, {"pmid": "16214947", "abstract": "Procymidone is a fungicide with anti-androgenic properties, widely used to protect fruits from fungal infection.

Therefore we examined the effects of long-term dietary administration (3 months) of the anti-androgen procymidone (26.4 mg/animal per day) or the phytoestrogen genistein (21.1 mg/animal per day) to rats on the pituitary-gonadal axis in vivo, as well as on Leydig cell steroidogenesis and on spermatogenesis ex vivo. The procymidone-containing diet elevated serum levels of LH and testosterone and, furthermore, Leydig cells isolated from procymidone-treated animals displayed an enhanced capacity for producing testosterone in response to stimulation by hCG or dibutyryl cAMP, as well as elevated expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage (P450 scc) and cytochrome P450 17alpha (P450c17). In contrast, the rate of DNA synthesis during stages VIII and IX of spermatogenesis in segments of seminiferous tubules isolated from genistein-treated rats was decreased without accompanying changes in the serum level of either LH or testosterone. Nonetheless, genistein did suppress the ex vivo steroidogenic response of Leydig cells to hCG or dibutyryl cAMP by down-regulating their expression of P450 scc.

Additionally we co-incubated the nonylphenol isomers with two concentrations of 17beta-estradiol (E2) in the MVLN cell assay to measure the potency of the isomers to compete with E2. No significant differences were found between the nonylphenol isomer binding affinities for the hERalpha. The IC(50) were in the range of 2.1-8.1x10(-6)M and the binding affinity relative to estradiol (set to 1) were between 2.6 and 6.7x10(-3). Only two test items (p353-NP and p-NP) were able to increase the estrogenic response of 100pM estradiol. The response of the other isomers co-incubated with 100pM E2 showed varying degrees of inhibition of the response in the MVLN reporter gene assay. Thus, it appears that all isomers bind to the ER but some are partial agonists while others are antagonists in the MVLN reporter gene assay.", "title": "Some nonylphenol isomers show antiestrogenic potency in the MVLN cell assay.", "related": ["", "endocrine disruptors", "estrogen antagonists", "estrogen receptor alpha", "ligands", "phenols", "estradiol", "nonylphenol", "demographic characteristics", "endocrine-disrupting chemicals", "health risk", "human exposure", "urine", "china", "demography", "endocrine disruptors", "female", "humans", "parabens", "triclosan", ""]}, {"pmid": "19884658", "abstract": "Studies in rodents have shown that male sexual function can be disrupted by fetal or neonatal administration of compounds that alter endocrine homeostasis, such as the synthetic nonsteroidal estrogen diethylstilbestrol (DES).

Recently, we showed that the orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (Nr0b2), which is both a target gene and a transcriptional repressor of estrogen receptors, controls testicular function by regulating germ cell entry into meiosis and testosterone synthesis. We therefore hypothesized that some of the harmful effects of DES on testes could be mediated through Nr0b2. Here, we present data demonstrating that Nr0b2 deficiency protected mice against the negative effects of DES on testis development and function. During postnatal development, Nr0b2-null mice were resistant to DES-mediated inhibition of germ cell differentiation, which may be the result of interference by Nr0b2 with retinoid signals that control meiosis. Adult Nr0b2-null male mice were also protected against the effects of DES; however, we suggest that this phenomenon was due to the removal of the repressive effects of Nr0b2 on steroidogenesis.

The results confirmed a physiological increase in AVP-immunoreactivity (AVP-IR) and gene expression in response to osmotic challenge as reported elsewhere. In contrast, the exposed groups did not show this response to osmotic activation, they showed significant reduction in AVP-IR neurons, and AVP mRNA expression as compared to the hyperosmotic controls. cFOS mRNA expression increased in A1254 dehydrated groups, suggesting that the AVP-IR decrease was not due to a lack of the response to the osmotic activation. Therefore, A1254 may interfere with the activation of AVP mRNA transcript levels and protein, causing a central dysfunction of vasopressinergic system.", "title": "Perinatal exposure to organohalogen pollutants decreases vasopressin content and its mRNA expression in magnocellular neuroendocrine cells activated by osmotic stress in adult rats.", "related": ["metabolic", "environmental pollutants", "halogenated diphenyl ethers", "proto-oncogene proteins c-fos", "rna", "messenger", "chlorodiphenyl (54% chlorine)", "arginine vasopressin", "sodium chloride", "pentabromodiphenyl ether", "", "administration", "oral", "animals", "atrazine", "body weight", "estrogen antagonists", "estrogens", "female", "organ size", "ovariectomy", "rats", "rats", "sprague-dawley", "receptors", "progesterone", "simazine", "uterus", "polychlorinated biphenyls (pcbs)", "aroclor 1254"]}, {"pmid": "28644961", "abstract": "[{'@Label': 'BACKGROUND', '#text': 'Environmental exposures are contributing factors to prostate cancer etiology, but these remain unclear.

Dyslipidemia was defined as the existence of one or more of the following conditions: high-LDL-cholesterolemia (LDL \u201a\u00e2\u2022140 mg/dL), hypertriglyceridemia (TGs \u201a\u00e2\u2022150 mg/dL), or low-HDL-cholesterolemia (HDL <40 mg/dL). Participants were stratified into tertiles according to low, median, and high baseline serum BPA levels. Multivariable linear and logistic regression models were used. Data from baseline and follow-up were used for cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, respectively.  In the cross-sectional analysis, compared to subjects in the low BPA tertile, those in the high BPA tertile showed a higher level of LDL cholesterol (108.1 \u00ac\u00b1 24.4 mg/dL versus 119.5 \u00ac\u00b1 26.9 mg/dL; <.05) and a lower level of HDL cholesterol (46.2 \u00ac\u00b1 11.7 mg/dL versus 39.5 \u00ac\u00b1 7.5 mg/dL; <.05). In multivariable linear regression models, Z-transformed BPA was positively associated with LDL cholesterol (\u0152\u2264= 0.13,  = .002) and negatively associated with HDL cholesterol (\u0152\u2264= -0.28; <.001). After cross-sectionally adjusting for confounders, subjects in higher BPA exposure was associated with a higher prevalence of low-HDL-cholesterolemia.

In this investigation, we assessed whether exposure to the OT in contaminated seafood resulted in abnormal fertility and pregnancy features and offspring complications. OT in contaminated seafood (LNI) was administered to female rats, and their fertility, pregnancy outcomes, and fetal liver morphology were assessed. LNI caused abnormal fertility, a reduction in the total number of pups, and an increase in serum testosterone levels compared to controls. Furthermore, LNI exposure caused irregular uterine morphology with inflammation and fibrosis and led to a reduction in embryonic implantation. In pregnant rats, LNI caused abnormal lipid profiles and livers with steatosis features. LNI exposure also causes placental morpho-physiology disruption, a high presence of glycogen and inflammatory cells, and irregular lipid profiles. In addition, LNI exposure caused an increase in large amounts of carbohydrate and lipid delivery to the fetus via an increase in placental nutrient sensor protein expressions (GLUT1, IR\u0152\u2264/mTOR and Akt). In both genders of offspring, LNI exposure led to an increase in body weights, liver megakaryocytes, lipid accumulation, and oxidative stress (OS) levels.

Frequently used plasticizers as the organophosphate ester tri-o-cresyl phosphate (TOCP) are known to affect the male reproductive system.

In this study, we investigated the molecular effects of TOCP on estrogen receptor \u0152\u00b1 (ER\u0152\u00b1)-transfected HEK-ESR1 cells and the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7.

This hypothesis implies that a male who has a Y chromosome that is from a male that was exposed to an endocrine disruptor will display a more severe reproductive phenotype than a male whose Y chromosome is from an unexposed male. To test this hypothesis, we used a mouse model in which F1 generation animals were exposed prenatally to an endocrine disruptor, di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), and the severity of impacted reproductive traits was compared between the F3 generation males that were descendants of F1 males (paternal lineage) and those from F1 females (maternal lineage).

The short-chain PFASs, pentafluorobenzoic acid, perfluorohexanoic acid, perfluorobutanesulfonic acid, and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid, homologous to PFOA or PFOS, did not significantly disrupt hPP generation, unlike PFOA and PFOS, based on pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1) expression.

Moreover, in some species of rodents, BPA exposure affected males' sexual behaviors. Interestingly, these behaviors are at least in part modulated by the catecholaminergic system, which has been reported to be a target of BPA action. In the present study we investigated the influence of prenatal exposure of mice to a very low single dose of BPA on emotional and sexual behaviors and on the density and binding characteristics of alpha adrenergic receptors. Alpha adrenergic receptors are widespread in the central nervous system and they can act as autoreceptors, inhibiting the release of noradrenaline and other neurotransmitters from presynaptic terminals. BPA exposure disrupted sex differences in behavioral responses to a novel environment, but did not affect male mice sexual behavior. Importantly, BPA exposure caused a change in the binding affinity of alpha adrenergic receptors in the locus coeruleus and medial preoptic area (mPOA) and it eliminated the sexual dimorphism in the density of the receptors in the mPOA.\"}", "title": "{'sub': '2', '#text': 'Effects of Prenatal Exposure to a Low-Dose of Bisphenol A on Sex Differences in Emotional Behavior and Central Alpha-Adrenergic Receptor Binding.'}", "related": ["", "air pollutants", "occupational", "benzhydryl compounds", "estrogens", "non-steroidal", "phenols", "receptors", "adrenergic", "alpha-2", "bisphenol a", "", "animals", "environmental exposure", "environmental pollution", "humans", "metabolic syndrome", "models", "biological", "obesity", "receptors", "cytoplasmic and nuclear", "signal transduction", ""]}, {"pmid": "32387388", "abstract": "Diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP) is one of synthetic phthalate plasticizers.

However, the effect directly on human sperm function is not known. The CatSper Ca channel in human sperm controls important sperm functions and is necessary for normal male fertility. Environmental chemicals have been shown to activate CatSper and thereby affect Ca signaling in human sperm. BPA has previously been investigated for effects on Ca signaling human sperm, whereas the effects of other BPA analogs are currently unknown. The aim of this study is thus to characterize the effect of BADGE, BPA, and the eight analogs BPG, BPAF, BPC, BPB, BPBP, BPE, BPF, BPS on Ca signaling, and CatSper in human sperm.  Direct effects of the bisphenols on Ca signaling in human sperm cells were evaluated using a Ca fluorimetric assay measuring changes in intracellular Ca. Effects via CatSper were assessed using the specific CatSper inhibitor RU1968. Effects on human sperm function was assessed using an image cytometry-based acrosome reaction assay and the modified Kremer's sperm-mucus penetration assay.  At 10 \u0152\u00baM the bisphenols BPG, BPAF, BPC, BADGE, BPB, and BPBP induced Ca signals in human sperm cells, whereas BPE, BPF, BPS, and BPA had no effect. The efficacy of the chemicals at 10 \u0152\u00baM is BPG > BPAF > BPC > BADGE > BPB > BPBP. Dose-response relations of BPG, BPAF, BPC, BADGE, BPB, and BPBP yielded EC50-values in the nM-\u0152\u00baM range. The induced Ca signals were almost completely abolished using the CatSper inhibitor RU1968, indicating an effect of the bisphenols on CatSper. All bisphenols, except BPBP, were found to dose-dependently inhibit progesterone-induced Ca signals, with BPG and BPAF displaying inhibition even in low \u0152\u00baM doses. BPG and BPAF were shown to affect human sperm function in a progesterone-like manner.  Our results show that the bisphenols BPG, BPAF, BPC, BADGE, BPB, and BPBP can affect Ca signaling in human sperm cells through activation of CatSper.

On the 21st and 45th day after the birth, male rats' lymph node and spleen samples were taken and histopathological examination was performed. Samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin to determine the general histological appearance, and with CD3 and CD20 immunohistochemically. The results of staining were evaluated by H-score, and statistical analysis was performed. In the samples, BPA applications were not found to cause significant tissue damage. But there was a significant decrease in the immunoreactivities of CD3 and CD20 after BPA applications in both 21st and 45th day samples. After high dose BPA administration, decreased CD3 immunoreactivity was statistically significant.

By examining DEHP metabolites in the urine of AR patients and building an AR model. 24 BALB/c mice were used as the study subjects, and ovalbumin (OVA) and DEHP (3\u00ac\u2020mg/kg/body) were used for intragastric administration. They were divided into control group, DEHP group, OVA group and OVA\u201a\u00c4\u00e2+\u201a\u00c4\u00e2DEHP group. Examination, behavioral scoring, inflammatory factor testing, oxidative stress testing, detection of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and signaling pathways CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 related proteins and mRNA. The concentrations of 3 metabolites of DEHP (MEHHP, MEOHP, and MEHP) in urine of AR patients were higher. And HE-staining showed that for the control group, many chronic inflammatory cell infiltration and nasal mucosal destruction were observed in the OVA\u201a\u00c4\u00e2+\u201a\u00c4\u00e2DEHP group and were more severe than the OVA group. Allergic symptom scores were obtained from sneezing, scratching, number of scratching, and nose flow. The scores of the OVA group and the OVA\u201a\u00c4\u00e2+\u201a\u00c4\u00e2DEHP group were higher than 7 points. Serum ELISA and nasal mucosal oxidative stress tests are more serious in the OVA\u201a\u00c4\u00e2+\u201a\u00c4\u00e2DEHP group. The expression of AhR protein and its mRNA was increased in the DEHP group, OVA group and OVA\u201a\u00c4\u00e2+\u201a\u00c4\u00e2DEHP group. The OVA\u201a\u00c4\u00e2+\u201a\u00c4\u00e2DEHP group was more significant in the OVA group and DEHP group. And the mRNAs of the AhR-related signaling pathways CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 were also more prominent in the OVA\u201a\u00c4\u00e2+\u201a\u00c4\u00e2DEHP group. DEHP may aggravate its inflammatory response through the AhR pathway closely related to the environment. When combined with OVA, DEHP can further aggravate the OVA-induced nasal inflammatory response and make the nasal cavity have undergone severe changes, and many inflammatory cells have infiltrated. DEHP has shown an adjuvant effect, and the AhR-related signaling pathways CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 may be critical.", "title": "Effect of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) on allergic rhinitis.", "related": ["respiratory", "environmental pollutants", "ovalbumin", "diethylhexyl phthalate", "cytochrome p-450 cyp1a1", "anxiety", "autonomic", "corticosterone", "emotional contagion", "social stress", "adrenocorticotropic hormone", "aggression", "animals", "autonomic nervous system", "behavior", "animal", "corticosterone", "heart rate", "hypothalamo-hypophyseal system", "male", "models", "animal", "motor activity", "pituitary-adrenal system", "rats", "rats", "wistar", "social behavior", "social environment", "stress", "psychological", "di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (dehp)"]}, {"pmid": "32887300", "abstract": "{'i': ['p', 'p', 'p', 'p', 'p', 'p'], '#text': \"The Pacific Island nation of Samoa is marked by prevalent obesity and an increasing dependence on packaged foods likely to contain the endocrine disruptor bisphenol-A (BPA).

In utero and lactational exposure to PBDE-47 boosted the weight gain while reduced the relative testis weight in adult male offspring. These were accompanied with the reductions in sperm counts (total and living sperm counts), the percentage of progressive sperm motility, sperm velocities (curvilinear velocity, straight-line velocity and average path velocity), motion path (beat cross frequency, linearity and wobble) and linear motile sperm parameters (count, motility and concentration). Further studies identified that the levels of serum triiodothyronine (T) were increased by PBDE-47 exposure and negatively associated with those differential semen parameters on quantity and motility. Collectively, our results indicate that exposure to low-level PBDE-47 during early-life development impairs semen quality in adult rats, which could be mediated partially by abnormal T levels.\"}", "title": "Impaired sperm quantity and motility in adult rats following gestational and lactational exposure to environmentally relevant levels of PBDE-47: A potential role of thyroid hormones disruption.", "related": ["reproductive", "flame retardants", "halogenated diphenyl ethers", "thyroid hormones", "2", "2'", "4", "4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether", "e-waste", "endocrine disruption", "hpt axis", "rare earth elements (rees)", "thyroid gland", "adult", "biomarkers", "china", "cross-sectional studies", "electronic waste", "endocrine disruptors", "environmental exposure", "environmental pollutants", "hormones", "humans", "male", "metals", "rare earth", "middle aged", "thyroid gland", "thyroid hormones", "2", "2'", "4", "4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether"]}, {"pmid": "33068574", "abstract": "[{'@Label': 'BACKGROUND', '#text': 'Environmental exposures acting through different mechanisms have been linked with a number of cancers.

One of the most widely used and studied, di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), has been labeled as an endocrine disruptor. The major and toxic metabolic derivative of DEHP, mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), is capable of interfering with mitochondrial function, but its mechanism of action on mitophagy remains elusive. Here, we report that MEHP exacerbates cytotoxicity by amplifying the PINK1-Parkin-mediated mitophagy pathway. First, MEHP exacerbated mitochondrial damage induced by low-dose CCCP via increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and enhanced fragmentation in mitochondria. Second, co-exposure to MEHP and CCCP (\"MEHP-CCCP\") induced robust mitophagy. Mechanistically, MEHP-CCCP stabilized PINK1, increased the level of phosphorylated ubiquitin (pSer 65-Ub), and led to Parkin mitochondrial translocation and activation. Third, MEHP-CCCP synergistically caused more cell death, while inhibition of mitophagy, either through chemical or gene silencing, reduced cell death. Finally and importantly, co-treatment with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) completely counteracted the effects of MEHP-CCCP, suggesting that mitochondrial ROS played a vital role in this process.

In this study, we examined the effects of pubertal exposure to DEHP and analyzed whether pubertal and adult exposures to DEHP trigger long-term effects. For pubertal exposure, male mice were exposed orally to the vehicle or DEHP at 5 or 50\u00ac\u2020\u0152\u00bag/kg/d from postnatal day (PND) 30 to PND60. Exposure was arrested and animals were analyzed on PND120. They exhibited normal olfactory preference but showed modified emission of ultrasonic vocalizations. DEHP exposure also affected partner preference and mating components. These modifications were associated with normal circulating testosterone levels and weight of androgen-sensitive tissues. In contrast, androgen receptor (AR) protein amount was reduced in the hypothalamic preoptic area in particular for the DEHP-50 group. Pubertal exposure also increased the anxiety-state level without changing circadian activity. When adult male mice were exposed to DEHP at the same doses from PND60 to PND105 and analyzed two months later, no effects of treatment on reproductive and anxiety-related behaviors or hypothalamic AR protein amount were seen.

The hormonal profile, oxidative stress biomarkers, DNA damage, and histological modifications were evaluated. Our main findings showed that KCrO promoted hypothyroidism, oxidative stress, genotoxicity, and histological alterations in the thyroid gland. The co-treatment with Se or ZnCl has mitigated KCrO-induced thyrotoxicity in pregnant Wistar rats by exhibiting antioxidant and genoprotective effects.

A common estrogen derivative, \u0152\u2264-estradiol, does not trigger SGs, indicating the mechanism of SG induction is not via the ER pathway.

The variable results from these related compounds suggest that structural homology is not a reliable predictor of the capacity of a compound to cause SGs.

In this study, we examined proteomic alterations in the livers of mouse dams and their male and female fetuses induced by vinclozolin, a model antiandrogenic EDC. Dam livers upregulated nine phase I and phase II detoxification pathways and pathway analysis revealed that more pathways are significantly enriched in dam livers than in fetal livers. Phase I and II detoxification proteins are also involved in steroid and steroid hormone biosynthesis and vinclozolin likely alters steroid levels in both the dam and the fetus. The response of the fetal liver proteome to vinclozolin exposure is sexually dimorphic. Female fetal livers upregulated proteins in xenobiotic metabolism pathways, whereas male fetal livers upregulated proteins in oxidative phosphorylation pathways. These results suggest that female fetuses increase protective mechanisms, whereas male fetuses increase ATP production and several disease pathways that are indicative of oxidative damage.

Male rats received BaP at environmentally relevant doses (0, 0.1, 1, or 10\u201a\u00c4\u00d8\u0152\u00bag/kg/day) orally from post-natal (PND) 23-53. On PND 90, treated males were mated with non-treated females for obtaining the next generation (F1). The paternal exposure to BaP decreased the body weight of offspring on PND 1, 13 and 22, as well as it provoked a reduction in the relative anogenital distance of the males. This exposure also brought forward the onset of puberty, evidenced by an earlier vaginal opening and first estrous in females of the lowest dose group and by a delay in the testicular descent and preputial separation ages in males. The males presented a decrease in the daily sperm production and a disrupted sperm morphology. Furthermore, the testicular histology was altered, evidenced by a reduction in the Leydig cell numbers and in the seminiferous tubules diameter, as well as a disrupted seminiferous tubules staging. The estrous cyclicity and some fertility parameters were changed in the females, as well as alterations in the ovary and uterus histology were observed.

Male C57BL/6 mice were orally exposed to TCS at the dosage of 10 mg/kg/d for 13 weeks. The hypothalamus was isolated and processed for mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics and metabolomics analyses. The results showed that a 10.6% decrease ( = 0.066) in body weight gain was observed in the TCS exposure group compared with vehicle control group. Differential analysis defined 52 proteins and 57 metabolites that delineated TCS exposed mice from vehicle controls. Among the differential features, multiple proteins and metabolites were found to play vital roles in neuronal signaling and function. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that these differentially expressed proteins and metabolites were involved in four major biological processes, including glucose metabolism, purine metabolism, neurotransmitter release, and neural plasticity, suggesting the disturbance of homeostasis in energy metabolism, mitochondria function, neurotransmitter system, and neuronal function.

In recent years, the increasing incidence of CVD among young people is observed, which may be related with inflammation rather than the traditional triple-H risk factors. BPA is an endocrine-disrupting chemical, and can induce oxidative stress and chronic inflammation since its estrogenic effect. Inflammatory responses could come from the stimulation of I\u0152\u222bB kinases (IKKs) by estrogen receptors (ERs).

In recent years, research focused on the intestinal flora has provided an idea to eliminate our confusion, and gut bacterial dysbiosis may contribute to female reproductive toxicity. In the present study, the feces of DEHP-exposed mice were collected and analyzed using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and untargeted global metabolite profiling of metabolomics. DEHP obviously causes reproductive toxicity, including the ovarian organ coefficient, estradiol level, histological features of the ovary and estrus. Furthermore, DEHP exposure alters the structure of the intestinal microbiota community and fecal metabolite profile in mice, suggesting that the reproductive toxicity may be caused by gut bacterial dysbiosis and altered metabolites, such as changes in the levels of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA). Additionally, it is well known that changes in gut microbiota and fecal metabolites cause inflammation and tissue oxidative stress, expectedly, we found oxidative stress in the ovary and systemic inflammation in DEHP exposed mice.

Rats were treated with vehicle (4% Tween 80) or butylparaben at dose levels of 2, 10, and 50\u00ac\u2020mg/kg/day for 13\u00ac\u2020weeks. Assessment of systemic toxicity and endocrine-disrupting effects was based on mortality; clinical signs; body weight; food and water consumption; ophthalmological findings; urinalysis; hematology and clinical biochemistry; organ weights; necropsy and histopathological findings; regularity and length of the estrous cycle; semen quality; and toxicokinetic behavior. Female uterine weight and estrous cycle, and male semen quality indicated no estrogenic effects. Butylparaben induced local irritation at the injection site in both sexes at a dose of 50\u00ac\u2020mg/kg/day, but systemic toxicity was not observed. Therefore, the no-observed-adverse-effect level of butylparaben is set at 50\u00ac\u2020mg/kg/day in rats of both sexes. Butylparaben was without endocrine system effects at this dose. Butylparaben displays dose-dependent systemic exposure up to the maximum dose of 50\u00ac\u2020mg/kg/day and repeated administration of butylparaben for 13\u00ac\u2020weeks shows no bioaccumulation.", "title": "Thirteen-week subcutaneous repeated dose toxicity study of butylparaben and its toxicokinetics in rats.", "related": ["", "parabens", "preservatives", "pharmaceutical", "butylparaben", "chlamys farreri", "organotin compounds (otcs)", "reconstituted yeast system", "retinoid x receptor (rxr)", "animals", "endocrine disruptors", "humans", "organotin compounds", "pectinidae", "retinoid x receptors", "saccharomyces cerevisiae", ""]}, {"pmid": "33847390", "abstract": "Bisphenol A (BPA) is used as a plasticizer in polycarbonate plastics.

Cox regression and linear models were used to determine associations between maternal phthalate levels and age at menarche, change in height and weight z-scores between birth and two years, height from birth to 20 years, BMI from two to 20 years, deviation from mid-parental height at age 20 and DEXA scan measures at age 20. Weak negative associations were detected with some phthalate metabolites and change in height and weight z-score during infancy. Weak positive associations between some of the high molecular weight phthalate metabolites and height z-score were detected during childhood.

This study aims to investigate the effects of prenatal propylparaben (PrP) exposure on the ovarian function of adult mice aged 46 weeks, which is equivalent to the age of 40 years in women.

Our results revealed that ovarian aging was accelerated in PrP-exposed mice at 46 weeks, with altered regularity of the estrous cycle, decreased serum estrogen (E2) and progesterone (P4) levels, reduced size of the primordial follicle pool, and increased number of atretic follicles. It was found that prenatal exposure to human-relevant doses of PrP exacerbated ovarian oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis, which promoted follicular atresia by activating the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. To compensate, the depletion of primordial follicles was also accelerated by activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in PrP-exposed mice. Moreover, PrP induced hypermethylation of CpG sites in the promoter region of Cyp11a1 (a 17.16-64.28% increase) partly led to the disrupted steroidogenesis, and the altered methylation levels of imprinted genes H19 and Peg3 may also contribute to the phenotypes observed.

However, these alternatives have had much less testing and oversight, yet they are already being mass-produced and used across industries from plastics to food-contact coatings. Here, we used human female adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs), a type of adult mesenchymal stem cell, to compare the effects of BPA and BPA alternatives on adipogenesis or fat cell development . We focused on two commonly used BPA replacements, bisphenol AF (BPAF) and tetramethyl bisphenol F (TMBPF; monomer of the new valPure V70 food-contact coating). Human ASCs were differentiated into adipocytes using chemically defined media in the presence of control differentiation media with and without 17\u0152\u2264-estradiol (E2; 10 \u0152\u00baM), or with increasing doses of BPA (0, 0.1 and 1 \u0152\u00baM), BPAF (0, 0.1, 1 and 10 nM), or TMBPF (0, 0.01 and 0.1 \u0152\u00baM). After differentiation, the cells were stained and imaged to visualize and quantify the accumulation of lipid vacuoles and number of developing fat cells. Treated cells were also examined for cell viability and apoptosis (programmed cell death) using the respective cellular assays. Similar to E2, BPA at 0.1 \u0152\u00baM and BPAF at 0.1 nM, significantly increased adipogenesis and lipid production by 20% compared to control differentiated cells (based on total lipid vacuole number to cell number ratios), whereas higher levels of BPA and BPAF significantly decreased adipogenesis ( < 0.005). All tested doses of TMBPF significantly reduced adipogenesis and lipid production by 30-40%, likely at least partially through toxic effects on stem cells, as viable cell numbers decreased and apoptosis levels increased throughout differentiation. These findings indicate that low, environmentally-relevant doses of BPA, BPAF, and TMBPF have significant effects on fat cell development and lipid accumulation, with TMBPF having non-estrogenic, anti-adipogenic effects.

To uncover DBP interacting molecular pathways, we raised Drosophila melanogaster on food containing dibutyl phthalate (DBP) at various concentrations. Whole transcriptome analysis of adult Drosophila reveals that DBP exposure throughout development disrupts the expression of genes central to circadian rhythm regulation, including increased expression of vrille (vri, human NFIL3), timeless (tim, human TIMELESS) and period (per, human PER3), with decreased expression of Pigment-dispersing factor (Pdf). DBP exposure also alters the expression of the evolutionarily conserved nuclear receptor Hormone receptor-like in 38 (Hr38, human NR4A2), which is known to regulate Pdf expression. Furthermore, behavioral assays determined that exposing Drosophila to DBP throughout development modifies the circadian rhythm of adults. Although DBP inhibits the expression of signaling systems regulating vision, including Rh5 and Rh6, two light-sensing G-protein coupled receptors involved in the daily resetting of circadian rhythm, it does not influence eye development. Circadian rhythm genes are well conserved from flies to humans; therefore, we tested the effect of DBP exposure on human breast cells (MCF10A) and demonstrate that, similar to the fruit fly model, this exposure disrupts circadian rhythm (BMAL1 expression) at doses that promote the proliferation and migration ability of MCF10A cells.

This study was conducted to explore the plausible modulatory effects of mangiferin (MF) against DEHP-induced testicular injury in rats. Thirty-two adult male albino rats were allocated into four groups. Two groups were given DEHP (2\u00ac\u2020g/kg/day, p.o) for 14 days. One of these groups was treated with MF (20\u00ac\u2020mg/kg/day, i.p) for 7 days before and 14 days after DEHP administration. A vehicle-treated control was included, and another group of rats was given MF only. Results revealed that MF treatment suppressed oxidative testicular injury by amplifying the mRNA expression of nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor-2 (Nrf2) and increasing hemoxygenase-1 (HO-1), glutathione, and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) levels. This treatment also enhanced superoxide dismutase activity, but it decreased malondialdehyde and nitric oxide levels. MF had an anti-inflammatory characteristic, as demonstrated by the downregulation of the mRNA of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u0152\u222bB). The content of tumor necrosis factor-alpha also decreased. MF modulated the apoptotic pathway by suppressing the mRNA of cytochrome c (Cyt c), Fas ligand content, Bax IHC expression, caspase-3 activity and cleaved caspase-3 IHC expression. It also upregulated the expression levels of heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) and B-cell lymphoma 2. Moreover, MF upregulated the mRNA expression levels of HSP70 and c-kit and enriched the content of steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein, which were reflected in serum testosterone levels. This result indicated that MF played crucial roles in steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis. Besides, the activities of testicular marker enzymes, namely, acid and alkaline phosphatases, and lactate dehydrogenase, significantly increased. Histopathological observations provided evidence supporting the biochemical and molecular measurements. In conclusion, MF provided protective mechanisms against the DEHP-mediated deterioration of testicular functions partially through its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties.

Perinatal development is a critical window for altered, lifelong health trajectory, and evidence supports the role of perinatal programming in chronic metabolic diseases. To examine the impact of diet and bisphenol A (BPA) on the developmental trajectory of NAFLD in offspring, we exposed dams from pre-gestation through lactation to a human-relevant dose of oral BPA coupled with intake of high fat Western or Mediterranean-style diets. We assessed hepatic steatosis by quantifying hepatic triglycerides (TGs) and metabolic health by measuring body weight, relative organ weights, and serum hormone levels in dams and offspring at postnatal day 10 (PND10) and 10-months of age. In dams, consumption of the Western or Mediterranean diet increased hepatic TGs 1.7-2.4-fold, independent of BPA intake. Among offspring, both perinatal diet and BPA exposure had a greater impact on metabolic outcomes than on hepatic steatosis. At PND10, serum leptin levels were elevated 2.6-4.8-fold in pups exposed to the Mediterranean diet, with a trend for sex-specific effects on body and organ weights. At 10-months, sex-specific increases in organ weight and hormone levels were observed in mice perinatally exposed to Western\u00ac\u2020+\u00ac\u2020BPA or Mediterranean\u00ac\u2020+\u00ac\u2020BPA. These findings suggest lifestage-specific interaction of perinatal exposures to experimental diets and BPA on offspring metabolic health without effects on NAFLD later in life.

However, the molecular mechanisms directly linking the actions of PCBs and OH-PCBs on the AR and ER to induce reproductive impairment remain poorly understood. In this study, we characterized the cellular response to PCBs and OH-PCBs acting on AR and ER transactivation at the transcriptome level coupled with bioinformatics analysis to identify the downstream pathways of androgen and estrogen signaling that leads to reproductive dysfunction. We first confirmed the agonistic and antagonistic effects of several PCBs and OH-PCBs on AR- and ER-mediated reporter gene activity using the androgen-responsive LNCaP and estrogen-responsive MCF-7 cell lines, respectively. Anti-estrogenic activity was not detected among the tested compounds; however, we found that in addition to anti-androgenic and estrogenic activity, PCB 28 and PCB 138 exhibited androgenic activity, while most of the tested OH-PCBs showed a synergistic effect on DHT-mediated transactivation of the AR. Bioinformatics analysis of transcriptome profiles from selected PCBs and OH-PCBs revealed various pathways that were dysregulated depending on their agonistic, antagonistic, or synergistic effects. The OH-PCBs with estrogenic activity affected pathways including vitamin metabolism and calcium transport. Other notable dysregulated pathways include cholesterol transport in response to androgenic PCBs, thyroid hormone metabolism in response to anti-androgenic PCBs, and antioxidant pathways in response to androgen-synergistic OH-PCBs.

Cypermethrin significantly decreased the protein expressions of cytosolic B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and mitochondrial cytochrome c (Cyt-c).

Cypermethrin decreased mitochondrial membrane potential significantly. Then, Bcl-2 family and Ca/CaM/CaMKII pathway participate in cypermethrin-induced homeostasis.

We detected a significant reduction in the proliferation of preadipocytes and an increased lipid accumulation during differentiation caused by HBB. This BFR also lead to a significant increased expression of IL-1\u0152\u2264 and decreased expression of PGC-1\u0152\u00b1 and adiponectin. Nevertheless, PBT, TBB and HBCD show to increase lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. PBT also display a significant increase of PPAR\u0152\u2265 gene expression.

Evidence has demonstrated that BPA disturbed bone health. However, few studies focused on the effect of BPA on osteocytes, making up over 95% of all the bone cells. Here, we reported that BPA inhibited the cell viability of MLO-Y4 cells, and increased apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, BPA up-regulated protein expressions of speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC), NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1 (Casp-1 p20) and cleaved gasdermin D (GSDMD-N), and increased the ratios of interleukin (IL)-1\u0152\u2264/pro-IL-1\u0152\u2264 and IL-18/pro-IL-18 in MLO-Y4 cells. BPA enhanced levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), IL-1\u0152\u2264 and IL-18 in culture supernatants. This pyroptotic death and the NLPR3 inflammasome activation were reversed by the caspase-1 inhibitor VX765 or the NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor MCC950. Furthermore, BPA stimulated the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial ROS (mtROS), elevated malondialdehyde (MDA) level and decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, which led to oxidative damage in MLO-Y4 cells. The ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or the mitochondrial antioxidant Mito-TEMPO inhibited the NLPR3 inflammasome activation and pyroptotic death induced by BPA.

Epidemiological studies have identified associations between exposures to various endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) with an increased risk for metabolic syndrome, obesity, and diabetes. Whether such adverse outcomes would be heightened by concurrent exposures to multiple EDCs during pregnancy, consistent with the reality that human exposures are to EDC mixtures, was examined in the current pilot study. Mouse dams were orally exposed to relatively low doses of four EDCs: (atrazine (10 mg/kg), bisphenol-A (50 \u00ac\u00b5g/kg), perfluorooctanoic acid (0.1 mg/kg), 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (0.036 \u00ac\u00b5g/kg)), or the combination (MIX), from gestational day 7 until birth or for an equivalent 12 days in non-pregnant females. Glucose intolerance, serum lipids, weight, and visceral adiposity were assessed six months later. MIX-exposed dams exhibited hyperglycemia with a persistent elevation in blood glucose two hours after glucose administration in a glucose tolerance test, whereas no such effects were observed in MIX-exposed non-pregnant females. Correspondingly, MIX dams showed elevated serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL). There were no statistically significant differences in weight or visceral adipose; MIX dams showed an average visceral adipose volume to body volume ratio of 0.09, while the vehicle dams had an average ratio of 0.07.

Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) are formed in infancy and their integrity is essential for spermatogenesis. Thus, understanding the impact of EDCs on SSCs is critical. Prostaglandins (PGs) are inflammatory mediators synthesized via the eicosanoid pathway starting with cyclooxygenases (Coxs), that regulate physiological and pathological processes. Our goal was to study the eicosanoid pathway in SSCs and examine whether it was disrupted by GEN and MEHP, potentially contributing to their adverse effects. The mouse C18-4 cell line used as SSC model expressed high levels of Cox1 and Cox2 genes and proteins, and eicosanoid pathway genes similarly to levels measured in primary rat spermatogonia. Treatments with GEN and MEHP at 10 and 100 \u0152\u00baM decreased Cox1 gene and protein expression, whereas Cox2, phospholipase A2, prostaglandin synthases transcripts, PGE2, PGF2a and PGD2 were upregulated. Simultaneously, the transcript levels of spermatogonia progenitor markers Foxo1 and Mcam and differentiated spermatogonial markers cKit and Stra8 were increased. Foxo1 was also increased by EDCs in primary rat spermatogonia. This study shows that the eicosanoid pathway is altered during SSC differentiation and that exposure to GEN and MEHP disrupts this process, mainly driven by GEN effects on Cox2 pathway, while MEHP acts through an alternative mechanism.

However, the impacts at the pituitary, specifically regarding signaling pathways engaged and direct effects on the gonadotropins LH and FSH, are unknown. We hypothesized prenatal exposure to DEHP during a critical period of embryonic development (e15.5 to e18.5) will cause sex-specific disruptions in reproduction-related mRNA expression in offspring's pituitary due to interference with androgen and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling. We found that prenatal DEHP exposure in vivo caused a significant increase in Fshb specifically in males, while the anti-androgen flutamide caused significant increases in both Lhb and Fshb in males. AhR target gene Cyp1b1 was increased in both sexes in DEHP-exposed offspring. In embryonic pituitary cultures, the DEHP metabolite MEHP increased Cyp1a1 and Cyp1b1 mRNA in both sexes and Cyp1b1 induction was reduced by co-treatment with AhR antagonist. AhR reporter assay in GHFT1 cells confirmed MEHP can activate AhR signaling. Lhb, Fshb and Gnrhr mRNA were significantly decreased in both sexes by MEHP, but co-treatment with AhR antagonist did not restore mRNA levels in pituitary culture. In summary, our data suggest phthalates can directly affect the function of the pituitary by activating AhR signaling and altering gonadotropin expression.

The effects of OPEs were compared with those of 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), a legacy brominated flame retardant. Alterations in several important cell features, including cell survival, mitochondrial dynamics, oxidative stress, lysosomes, and lipid droplets, were analyzed. Most of the OPEs tested displayed higher cytotoxicity than BDE-47 in all 3 cell lines. Effects on phenotypic parameters were specific for each cell type. Several OPEs increased total mitochondria, decreased lysosomes, increased the total area of lipid droplets, and induced oxidative stress in KGN cells; these endpoints were differentially affected in MA-10 and C18-4 cells. Alterations in cell phenotypes were highly correlated in the 2 steroidogenic cell lines for a few triaryl OPEs. Potency ranking using 2 complementary approaches, Toxicological Prioritization Index analyses and the lowest benchmark concentration/administered equivalent dose method, revealed that while most of the OPEs tested were more potent than BDE-47, others showed little to no effect.

At the origin of these diseases, exposure to challenges during developmental windows of vulnerability (peri-conception, in utero, and early infancy periods) have been incriminated. Among the challenges that have been described, endocrine disruptors are of high concern because of their omnipresence in the environment. Worrisomely, since birth, children are exposed to a significant number of endocrine disruptors. However, the role of such early exposure on long-term cardiac health is poorly described. In this context, based on a model of rats exposed postnatally and transiently to an estrogenic compound prototype (estradiol benzoate, EB), we aimed to delineate the effects on the adult heart of such transient early exposure to endocrine disruptors and identify the underlying mechanisms involved in the potential pathogenesis. We found that this transient post-natal exposure to EB induced cardiac hypertrophy in adulthood, with increased cardiomyocyte size. The evaluation of cardiac calcium signaling, through immunoblot approaches, highlighted decreased expression of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2 (SERCA2) and decreased Nuclear Factor of Activated T Cells (NFAT3) phosphorylation as a potential underlying mechanism of cardiac hypertrophy. Furthermore, the treatment of cardiomyocytes with EB in vitro induced a decrease in SERCA2 protein levels. Overall, our study demonstrates that early transient exposure to EB induces permanent cardiac alterations. Together, our data highlight SERCA2 down-regulation as a potential mechanism involved in the cardiac pathogenesis induced by EB.

In adults, thyroid hormones (THs) are regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis, but also by organs such as the liver and potentially the gut microbiota. PFOS and other xenobiotics can therefore disrupt the TH system at various locations and through different mechanisms. To start addressing this, we exposed adult male rats to 3\u00ac\u2020mg PFOS/kg/day for 7 days and analysed effects on multiple organs and pathways simultaneously by transcriptomics. This included four primary organs involved in TH regulation, namely hypothalamus, pituitary, thyroid, and liver. To investigate a potential role of the gut microbiota in thyroid hormone regulation, two additional groups of animals were dosed with the antibiotic vancomycin (8\u00ac\u2020mg/kg/day), either with or without PFOS. PFOS exposure decreased thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) without affecting thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), resembling a state of hypothyroxinemia. PFOS exposure resulted in 50 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the hypothalamus, 68 DEGs in the pituitary, 71 DEGs in the thyroid, and 181 DEGs in the liver. A concomitant compromised gut microbiota did not significantly change effects of PFOS exposure. Organ-specific DEGs did not align with TH regulating genes; however, genes associated with vesicle transport and neuronal signaling were affected in the hypothalamus, and phase I and phase II metabolism in the liver. This suggests that a decrease in systemic TH levels may activate the expression of factors altering trafficking, metabolism and excretion of TH.

Conversely, the endocrine disruptor bisphenol-A (BPA), which exerts multiple effects in this cell type via the same estrogen receptors, increased basal apoptosis. The molecular-initiated events that trigger these opposite actions have yet to be identified. We demonstrated that combined genetic downregulation and pharmacological blockade of each estrogen receptor increased apoptosis to a different extent. The increase in apoptosis induced by BPA was diminished by the pharmacological blockade or the genetic silencing of GPER, and it was partially reproduced by the GPER agonist G1.

We hypothesized that gestational BPA exposure results in a preadipocyte phenotype that leads to accelerated adipogenic differentiation, and that this phenotype is sex specific. Primary ovine fetal preadipocytes were derived from control (C) and BPA-exposed during pregnancy and differentiated in vitro. Gestational BPA enhanced lipid accumulation at early stages of differentiation (48\u00ac\u2020h) and this was evident in females but not male-derived fetal preadipocytes.

We successfully adapted a maternal DEHP exposure model in female pregnant/lactating mice. Then we determined effects of DEHP exposure on food intake, body weight and milk production as well as the alterations in endocrine factors in lactating mice. The integrated metabonomic and transcriptomic analyses of the mammary gland were performed to measure the changed metabolites and genes related to DEHP exposure-induced lactation alterations. We observed the reduced food intake with elevated blood leptin and the decreased milk yield as well as the reduced levels of serum prolactin, growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor 1 and insulin after exposed to DEHP. Furthermore, 208 metabolites and 3452 genes were separately identified as differentially expressed features associated with DEHP exposure.

Body fluid balance is maintained by a complex network of systems that regulate sodium and water intakes and electrolyte excretion. The development of these control systems occurs during early life and therefore, may be susceptible to changes in the uterine environment. The aim of this work was to study the effects of two low BPA doses in the dam, during pregnancy and lactation, on adult offspring drinking and sodium and urine excretion after dipsogenic challenge. Dams were exposed to BPA in drinking water to mimic the most likely route of human exposure. The results showed that BPA did not disrupt spontaneous fluid balance, but altered sodium and fluid intakes in the BPA offspring under osmotic challenges. In experiments, both 24h fluid deprivation and sodium depletion modified fluid ingestive response in BPA offspring compared to control offspring. The increased preference for 2.7% NaCl solution in male BPA offspring is similar to female control offspring, altered ingestive behavior appears to be due to feminization of males and \"hyperfeminization\" of female BPA offspring, as they drink more than female control offspring.

DNA methylation was quantitatively assessed by bisulphite pyrosequencing on 3 LINEs and 5 SINEs. Unadjusted linear regression analyses showed that higher concentration of maternal urinary BPA in 24th week's pregnancy was associated with an increase in LINE-1 methylation in all newborns (p = 0.01) and, particularly, in male newborns (p = 0.03).

Methodology included in vivo experiment on male Wistar rats exposed to low doses of DDT during prenatal and postnatal development and morphological assessment of thymic involution, including the immunohistochemical detection of proliferating thymocytes.

Histological and immunohistochemical examinations revealed increased cellularity of the cortex and the medulla, higher content of lymphoblasts, and more intensive proliferation rate of thymocytes compared to the control. Evaluation of thymic epithelial cells revealed a higher rate of thymic corpuscles formation. Conclusion: The data obtained indicate that endocrine disrupter DDT disturbs postnatal development of the thymus.

Experimental techniques such as RNA immunoprecipitation, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and co-immunoprecipitation were used to verify direct binding interactions among lncRNA PVT1, EZH2, DNMT1, and ZBP1. The evidence obtained indicated that lncRNA PVT1 could bind to DNMT1 via EZH2 and increase methylation at the ZBP1 promoter, thereby promoting necroptosis. Meanwhile, the demethylation of the highly expressed gene TET1 also promoted ZBP1 upregulation, inducing necroptosis.

The percentages of small and large adipocytes in WAT began to significantly increase or decrease from 1 mg/kg (all  < 0.05), respectively.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of gestational BPA exposure on hepatic lipid metabolism and its possible mechanism in male offspring. The pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to BPA (0, 0.05, 0.5, 5\u00ac\u2020mg/kg/day) from day 5 to day 19 of gestation to investigate the levels of triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC), and the expression of liver lipid metabolism-related genes in male offspring rats. The results showed that compared with the control group, the TG and TC levels in serum and liver in BPA-exposed groups was increased. And the expressions of liver fatty acid oxidation related genes, such as peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor \u0152\u00b1 (PPAR\u0152\u00b1) and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1\u0152\u00b1 (CPT1\u0152\u00b1), were down-regulated. However, the expressions of fatty acid synthesis related genes, such as sterol regulatory element binding proteins 1 (SREBP-1), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), fatty acid synthase (FAS) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD-1), were up-regulated. The increased protein levels of mTOR and p-CRTC2 suggested that CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2) might be an important mediator in the mTOR/SREBP-1 pathway. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that mTOR/CRTC2/SREBP-1 could be affected by gestational BPA exposure, which may involve in the lipid metabolic disorders in later life.", "title": "Gestational bisphenol A exposure impairs hepatic lipid metabolism by altering mTOR/CRTC2/SREBP1 in male rat offspring.", "related": ["metabolic", "benzhydryl compounds", "endocrine disruptors", "fatty acids", "ppar alpha", "peroxisome proliferators", "phenols", "sterol regulatory element binding protein 1", "triglycerides", "cholesterol", "stearoyl-coa desaturase", "transferases", "fatty acid synthases", "mtor protein", "rat", "tor serine-threonine kinases", "acetyl-coa carboxylase", "bisphenol a", "carnitine", "cancer", "endocrine disruption", "human relevance", "thyroid adenoma", "thyroid carcinoma", "acrylates", "animals", "carcinogens", "dogs", "female", "humans", "male", "mice", "neoplasms", "experimental", "rats", "species specificity", "stomach", "stomach neoplasms", "thyroid gland", "thyroid hormones", "thyroid neoplasms", "toxicity tests", "chronic", "bisphenol a"]}, {"pmid": "36142703", "abstract": "Bisphenol S (BPS) is increasingly being used as an alternative for bisphenol A; however, its health effects remain unclear.

Humans are exposed to BPA, which directly or indirectly causes endocrine dysfunctions that lead to metabolic disorders like obesity, fatty liver diseases, insulin resistance, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and other endocrine-related imbalances. The duration, quantity, and period of exposure to BPA, especially during the critical stage of development, determine its impact on reproductive and non-reproductive health. Because of its endocrine-disrupting effects, the European Chemical Agency has added BPA to the candidate list of chemicals of very high concern. Due to its estrogenic properties and structural similarities with thyroid hormones, BPA disrupts the endocrine system at different levels. It interacts with estrogen receptors at the molecular level and acts as an antagonist or agonist via an estrogen receptor-dependent signaling pathway. In particular, BPA binds to G-protein coupled receptors and estrogen receptors, activating signaling pathways that influence cellular apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation, and inflammation. BPA acts as an obesogen that promotes adipogenesis and correlates with increased lipid accumulation and elevated expression of adipogenic markers. As a metabolic and endocrine disruptor, BPA impairs cellular homeostasis by increasing oxidative mediators and decreasing antioxidant enzymes, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction.

In the United States, obesity affects 40% of women and 20% of girls, with higher rates in minority females. Obesity causes infertility, poor oocyte quality, miscarriage, and offspring defects. This study proposed that PFOA exposure would impact estrous cyclicity, ovarian steroid hormones, and the ovarian proteome and further hypothesized that obesity would impact PFOA-induced ovotoxicity.

To understand the underlying mechanisms, we performed histological, endocrinological, and biochemical analyses and assessed the expression of genes involved in spermatogenesis and sperm function according to OECD test guideline 407. Following 28 days of administration of the lowest observed adverse effect level dose of DBP to mice, no significant changes in body weight, testis and epididymis weights and histology, serum testosterone level, or testicular daily sperm production were found. Nonetheless, the motility of the epididymal sperm of the DBP group was significantly decreased together with an increase in the incidence of bent tails and abnormal heads. In the testes of the DBP group, lipid peroxidation (LPO) level was significantly increased and testicular Bcl-2 mRNA level was significantly decreased together with an increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 mRNA ratio. In the testes of the DBP group, levels of Prnd mRNA and protein and Pou4f1 mRNA, an activator of the Prnd promotor, were significantly decreased. Of note, prion-like protein doppel (PRND) was significantly decreased together with decreased PRND immunoreactivity in the head, midpiece, and tail of sperm. In the testes of the DBP group, levels of Sox9, Sgp1, and Sgp2 mRNA, which are functional Sertoli cell markers, were significantly decreased. Level of Amh mRNA, a Sertoli cell immaturity marker, was significantly increased together with that of Inha mRNA, suggesting deregulation of the brain-gonadal axis. Together, our findings suggest that DBP at present dosage may potentiate LPO generation and Sertoli cell immaturity via downregulation of Sox9 and disruption of the Pou4f1-Prnd gene network in post-meiotic germ cells without visible changes in spermatogenesis or testosterone level.

Its exposure has been linked to male infertility in animals and humans due to its ability to induce epigenetic modification. Despite extensive research confirming the impact of BPA on epigenetic regulation, fundamental concerns about how BPA causes epigenetic changes and the underlying mechanism of BPA on the male reproductive system remain unresolved. Therefore, we sought to investigate the effects of BPA on epigenetic regulation and the histone-to-protamine (PRM) transition, which is fundamental process for male fertility in testes and spermatozoa by exposing male mice to BPA for 6\u00ac\u2020weeks while giving the mice in the control group corn oil by oral gavage. Our results demonstrated that the mRNA levels of the histone family and PRMs were significantly altered by BPA exposure in testes and spermatozoa. Subsequently, core histone proteins, the PRM1/PRM2 ratio, directly linked to male fertility, and transition proteins were significantly reduced. Furthermore, we discovered that BPA significantly caused abnormal histone-to-protamine replacement during spermiogenesis by increased histone variants-related to histone-to-PRM transition. The levels of histone H3 modification in the testes and DNA methylation in spermatozoa were significantly increased. Consequently, sperm concentration/motility/hyperactivation, fertilization, and early embryonic development were adversely affected as a consequence of altered signaling proteins following BPA exposure.

The primary insecticidal mode of action of OP insecticides relies on (irreversible) binding to acetylcholine esterase (AChE), with -oxon metabolites having a much higher potency for AChE inhibition than the parent compounds. However, OP insecticides can also have non-AChE-mediated effects, including changes in gene expression, neuroendocrine effects, disruption of neurite outgrowth and disturbance of the intracellular calcium (Ca) homeostasis. Since Ca is involved in neurotransmission and neuronal development, our research aimed to assess the effects of two widely used OP insecticides, chlorpyrifos (CPF) and diazinon (DZ) and their respective -oxon metabolites, on intracellular Ca homeostasis in human SH-SY5Y cells and rat primary cortical cultures. Furthermore, we assessed the acute and chronic effects of exposure to these compounds on neuronal network maturation and function in rat primary cortical cultures using microelectrode array (MEA) recordings. While inhibition of AChE appears to be the primary mode of action of oxon-metabolites, our data indicate that both parent OP insecticides (CPF and DZ) inhibit depolarization-evoked Ca influx and neuronal activity at concentrations far below their sensitivity for AChE inhibition, indicating that inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels is a common mode of action of OP insecticides. Notably, parent compounds were more potent than their oxon metabolites, with exposure to diazinon-oxon (DZO) having no effect on both neuronal activity and Ca influx. Human SH-SY5Y cells were more sensitive to OP-induced inhibition of depolarization-evoked Ca influx than rat cortical cells. Acute exposure to OP insecticides had more potent effects on neuronal activity than on Ca influx, suggesting that neuronal activity parameters are especially sensitive to OP exposure. Interestingly, the effects of DZ and chlorpyrifos-oxon (CPO) on neuronal activity lessened after 48\\xa0h of exposure, while the potency of CPF did not differ over time. This suggests that neurotoxicity after exposure to different OPs has different effects over time and occurs at levels that are close to human exposure levels. In line with these results, chronic exposure to CPF during 10 days impaired neuronal network development, illustrating the need to investigate possible links between early-life OP exposure and neurodevelopmental disorders in children and highlighting the importance of non-AChE mediated mechanisms of neurotoxicity after OP exposure.'}", "title": "Organophosphate insecticides disturb neuronal network development and function via non-AChE mediated mechanisms.", "related": ["neurological", "", "", "adolescent", "adult", "analysis of variance", "area under curve", "clonidine", "disruptive", "impulse control", "and conduct disorders", "double-blind method", "gambling", "human growth hormone", "humans", "neurosecretory systems", "receptors", "adrenergic", "alpha-2", "chlorpyrifos", "diazinon"]}, {"pmid": "36347349", "abstract": "The incidence of thyroid cancer (TC), especially papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), has dramatically increased globally.

However, all allowed parabens in cosmetics were predicted as samples with potentially sensitizing properties in the LuSens and h-CLAT test methods, but not confirmed by DPRA.

Alterations of the GnRH-network, especially during development, lead to long-term reproductive and systemic consequences, also causing infertility. Recent evidence shows that benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), a diffuse pollutant that can play a role as an endocrine disruptor, affects gonadal function and gamete maturation, whereas data demonstrating its impact at hypothalamic level are very scarce. This study investigated the effects of BaP (10\u00ac\u2020\u0152\u00baM) in a primary cell culture isolated from the human fetal hypothalamus (hfHypo) and exhibiting a clear GnRH neuron phenotype. BaP significantly decreased gene and protein expression of both GnRH and kisspeptin receptor (KISS1R), the master regulator of GnRH neuron function. Moreover, BaP exposure increased phospho-ERK1/2 signaling, a well-known mechanism associated with KISS1R activation. Interestingly, BaP altered the electrophysiological membrane properties leading to a significant depolarizing effect and it also significantly increased GnRH release, with both effects being not affected by kisspeptin addition. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that BaP may alter GnRH neuron phenotype and function, mainly interfering with KISS1R signaling and GnRH secretion and therefore with crucial mechanisms implicated in the central neuroendocrine control of reproduction.", "title": "Effects of benzo[a]pyrene on the reproductive axis: Impairment of kisspeptin signaling in human gonadotropin-releasing hormone primary neurons.", "related": ["", "", "endocrine disruptors", "mitochondria", "receptors", "aryl hydrocarbon", "renal insufficiency", "chronic", "cohort studies", "humans", "kidney", "mitochondria", "odds ratio", "prospective studies", ""]}, {"pmid": "36464114", "abstract": "Many endocrine disruptors have been proven to impair the meiotic process which is required for the production of healthy gametes.
