24231043,-273,Bisphenol A,Neurological,Bisphenol A promotes dendritic morphogenesis of hippocampal neurons through estrogen receptor-mediated ERK1/2 signal pathway.,"Bisphenol A (BPA), an environmental endocrine disruptor, has attracted increasing attention to its adverse effects on brain developmental process. The previous study indicated that BPA rapidly increased motility and density of dendritic filopodia and enhanced the phosphorylation of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit NR2B in cultured hippocampal neurons within 30min. The purpose of the present study was further to investigate the effects of BPA for 24h on dendritic morphogenesis and the underlying mechanisms. After cultured for 5d in vitro, the hippocampal neurons from 24h-old rat were infected by AdV-EGFP to indicate time-lapse imaging of living neurons. The results demonstrated that the exposure of the cultured hippocampal neurons to BPA (10, 100nM) or 17-estradiol (17-E2, 10nM) for 24h significantly promoted dendritic development, as evidenced by the increased total length of dendrite and the enhanced motility and density of dendritic filopodia. However, these changes were suppressed by an ERs antagonist, ICI182,780, a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801, and a mitogen-activated ERK1/2-activating kinase (MEK1/2) inhibitor, U0126. Meanwhile, the increased F-actin (filamentous actin) induced by BPA (100nM) was also completely eliminated by these blockers. Furthermore, the result of western blot analyses showed that, the exposure of the cultures to BPA or 17-E2 for 24h promoted the expression of Rac1/Cdc42 but inhibited that of RhoA, suggesting Rac1 (Ras related C3 botulinum toxinsubstrate 1)/Cdc42 (cell divisioncycle 42) and RhoA (Ras homologous A), the Rho family of small GTPases, were involved in BPA- or 17-E2-induced changes in the dendritic morphogenesis of neurons. These BPA- or 17-E2-induced effects were completely blocked by ICI182,780, and were partially suppressed by U0126. These results reveal that, similar to 17-E2, BPA exerts its effects on dendritic morphogenesis by eliciting both nuclear actions and extranuclear-initiated actions that are integrated to influence the development of dendrite in hippocampal neurons.","Benzhydryl Compounds,ESR1 protein, human,Endocrine Disruptors,Estrogen Receptor alpha,NR2B NMDA receptor,Phenols,Receptors, Estrogen,Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate,Estradiol,bisphenol A",,"Animals,Bone Density,Bone Development,Bone and Bones,Insulin-Like Growth Factor I,Mice,Mice, Transgenic,Models, Animal,Signal Transduction"
12083628,-248,"7,12-dimethylbenz(a) anthracene",Reproductive,"Long-term effects of the mammary carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz(a) anthracene on hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone and its pituitary receptor gene expression, during the promotion stage, in female Sprague-Dawley rats.","A single intragastric administration of 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) has been shown to induce mammary tumors in young cycling female Sprague-Dawley rats. The appearance of these tumors is preceded by a series of neuroendocrine disturbances, including attenuation of the preovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) surge and amplification of the preovulatory 17beta-estradiol surge, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) released in vitro. In this study, we examined the hypothesis that DMBA administration decreases levels of GnRH mRNA in the preoptic area-anterior hypothalamus (POA-AH) and GnRH receptor (GnRH Rc) mRNA and protein in the anterior pituitary gland. Sprague-Dawley rats, 55-60 days of age with regular estrous cycles, received a single dose of 15 mg DMBA in 1 ml sesame oil delivered by intragastric intubation. A first series of experiments was performed for the measurement of hypothalamic GnRH mRNA and pituitary GnRH Rc mRNA levels. A second series of experiments was performed for the measurement of pituitary GnRH receptor. In both experiments, animals were sacrificed by decapitation at 11.00, 16.00, 18.00 and 20.00 h on each day of the 7th or 8th estrous cycle (28-32 days) after treatment. GnRH and GnRH receptor mRNAs were quantified using solution hybridization-RNase protection assay. The GnRH Rc was quantified using the 125I-D-Ala6-N-Met-Leu6-des-Gly10-ethylamide GnRH. DMBA-treatment produced no significant effect on the overall mean values of GnRH mRNA. GnRH mRNA levels in control rats rose significantly between 16.00 and 20.00 h on proestrus and between 18.00 and 20.00 h on diestrus I. DMBA-treated rats had a surge in GnRH mRNA levels at 18.00 h on proestrus, and showed additional surges at 18.00h on diestrus II and estrus. GnRH receptor mRNA content in the anterior pituitary gland surged at 16.00h on certain days of the cycle in both groups of rats. In control rats, only the surge on diestrus II proved significant, whereas DMBA-treated rats exhibited significant surges on diestrus I, diestrus II and proestrus. GnRH receptor mRNA values were significantly lower on both days of diestrus in DMBA-treated rats compared with controls. GnRH Rc peptide content, like GnRH receptor in RNA surged at 16.00h in both groups with the exception of a marked fall on proestrus day for DMBA treated rats. A reduction in the amplitude of the surge was also seen on the day of estrous and to a lesser extend on the day of diestrus DII in DMBA treated animal. Overall, there was a disruption of the GnRH Rc pattern which culminate on the day of proestrus in DMBA-treated animals. Interestingly, the daily rise between 11.00 and 16.00h which is the more pronounced on the day of proestrus in control animals, was completely blunted in DMBA-treated rats. Overall, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that the carcinogen attenuates, directly or indirectly, preovulatory biosynthesis of the GnRH receptor and LH release. Obviously, the changes in GnRH might occur simultaneously, independently from mammary tumorigenesis, but may play a role, in association with others DMBA-induced neuroendocrine disorders, in the promotion stage of mammary tumors in the Sprague-Dawley female rat.","Carcinogens,RNA Probes,RNA, Messenger,Receptors, LHRH,Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone,9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene,Ribonuclease, Pancreatic",,"Animals,Environmental Pollutants,Polychlorinated Biphenyls,Receptors, Estrogen,Sex Distribution,Temperature,Turtles"
16298753,-227,"Polychlorinated biphenyl, Aroclor 1254",Cell death,Studies on the protective role of vitamin C and E against polychlorinated biphenyl (Aroclor 1254)--induced oxidative damage in Leydig cells.,"Free radical production and lipid peroxidation are potentially important mediators in testicular physiology and toxicology. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are global environmental contaminants that cause disruption of the endocrine system in human and animals. The present study was conducted to elucidate the protective role of vitamin C and E against Aroclor 1254-induced changes in Leydig cell steroidogenesis and antioxidant system. Adult male rats were dosed for 30 days with daily intraperitoneal (ip) injection of 2 mg/kg Aroclor or vehicle (corn oil). One group of rats was treated with vitamin C (100 mg/kg bw/day) while the other group was treated with vitamin E (50 mg/kg bw/day) orally, simultaneously with Aroclor 1254 for 30 days. One day after the last treatment, animals were euthanized and blood was collected for the assay of serum hormones such as luteinizing hormone (LH), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), prolactin (PRL), triiodothyronine (T(3)), thyroxine (T(4)), testosterone and estradiol. Testes were quickly removed and Leydig cells were isolated in aseptic condition. Purity of Leydig cells was determined by 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3beta-HSD) staining method. Purified Leydig cells were used for quantification of cell surface LH receptors and steroidogenic enzymes such as cytochrome P(450) side chain cleavage enzyme (P(450)scc), 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3beta-HSD) and 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17beta- HSD). Leydig cellular enzymatic antioxidants superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and non-enzymatic antioxidants such as vitamin C and E were assayed. Lipid peroxidation (LPO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were also estimated in Leydig cells. Aroclor 1254 treatment significantly reduced the serum LH, TSH, PRL, T(3), T(4), testosterone and estradiol. In addition to this, Leydig cell surface LH receptors, activities of the steroidogenic enzymes such as cytochrome P(450)scc, 3beta-HSD, 17beta-HSD, antioxidant enzymes SOD, CAT, GPX, GR, gamma-GT, GST and non-enzymatic antioxidants such as vitamin C and E were significantly diminished whereas, LPO and ROS were markedly elevated. However, the simultaneous administration of vitamin C and E in Aroclor 1254 exposed rats resulted a significant restoration of all the above-mentioned parameters to the control level. These observations suggest that vitamin C and E have ameliorative role against adverse effects of PCB on Leydig cell steroidogenesis.","Antioxidants,Antithyroid Agents,Chorionic Gonadotropin,Free Radicals,Lipids,Peptides,Reactive Oxygen Species,Steroids,Triiodothyronine,Chlorodiphenyl (54% Chlorine),Vitamin E,Testosterone,Estradiol,Prolactin,Luteinizing Hormone,Thyrotropin,Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System,3-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases,Glutathione Peroxidase,gamma-Glutamyltransferase,Glutathione Transferase,Ascorbic Acid,Thyroxine",,"Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Aging,Cause of Death,Child,Female,Follow-Up Studies,Humans,Male,Mental Disorders,Middle Aged,Poisoning,Risk Factors,Sex Factors,Suicide,Suicide, Attempted,Time Factors"

The metabolic-disrupting effects of perinatal exposure to industrial penta-PBDE mixture, DE-71, on male and female progeny of C57BL/6N mouse dams were examined in adulthood. Dams were exposed to environmentally relevant doses of PBDEs daily for 10 weeks (): 0.1 (L-DE-71) and 0.4 mg/kg/d (H-DE-71) and offspring parameters were compared to corn oil vehicle controls (VEH/CON). The following lipid metabolism indices were measured: plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, adiponectin, leptin, and liver lipids. L-DE-71 female offspring were particularly affected, showing hypercholesterolemia, elevated liver lipids and fasting plasma leptin as compared to same-sex VEH/CON, while L- and H-DE-71 male F1 only showed reduced plasma adiponectin.

A positive correlation between increased urinary AA metabolite concentration and reduced levels of thyroid hormones (TH) was described in adolescents and young adults.

The expression of molecular markers of HPT functionality was investigated in the hypothalamus, pituitary, thyroid, heart and liver, as well as the hormonal and lipid profiles in blood samples. Herein, we showed that AA acts as EDCs for thyroid gland function, increasing the transcript expression of several proteins related to TH synthesis and altering hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis homeostasis, an effect evidenced by the higher levels of THs in the serum. Compensatory mechanisms were observed in TH-target tissues, such as an increase in  mRNA expression in the liver and a reduction in  transcript content in the hearts of AA-treated rats.

However, the effect directly on human sperm function is not known. The CatSper Ca channel in human sperm controls important sperm functions and is necessary for normal male fertility. Environmental chemicals have been shown to activate CatSper and thereby affect Ca signaling in human sperm. BPA has previously been investigated for effects on Ca signaling human sperm, whereas the effects of other BPA analogs are currently unknown. The aim of this study is thus to characterize the effect of BADGE, BPA, and the eight analogs BPG, BPAF, BPC, BPB, BPBP, BPE, BPF, BPS on Ca signaling, and CatSper in human sperm.  Direct effects of the bisphenols on Ca signaling in human sperm cells were evaluated using a Ca fluorimetric assay measuring changes in intracellular Ca. Effects via CatSper were assessed using the specific CatSper inhibitor RU1968. Effects on human sperm function was assessed using an image cytometry-based acrosome reaction assay and the modified Kremer's sperm-mucus penetration assay.  At 10 ŒºM the bisphenols BPG, BPAF, BPC, BADGE, BPB, and BPBP induced Ca signals in human sperm cells, whereas BPE, BPF, BPS, and BPA had no effect. The efficacy of the chemicals at 10 ŒºM is BPG > BPAF > BPC > BADGE > BPB > BPBP. Dose-response relations of BPG, BPAF, BPC, BADGE, BPB, and BPBP yielded EC50-values in the nM-ŒºM range. The induced Ca signals were almost completely abolished using the CatSper inhibitor RU1968, indicating an effect of the bisphenols on CatSper. All bisphenols, except BPBP, were found to dose-dependently inhibit progesterone-induced Ca signals, with BPG and BPAF displaying inhibition even in low ŒºM doses. BPG and BPAF were shown to affect human sperm function in a progesterone-like manner.  Our results show that the bisphenols BPG, BPAF, BPC, BADGE, BPB, and BPBP can affect Ca signaling in human sperm cells through activation of CatSper.

Results revealed that MF treatment suppressed oxidative testicular injury by amplifying the mRNA expression of nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor-2 (Nrf2) and increasing hemoxygenase-1 (HO-1), glutathione, and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) levels. This treatment also enhanced superoxide dismutase activity, but it decreased malondialdehyde and nitric oxide levels. MF had an anti-inflammatory characteristic, as demonstrated by the downregulation of the mRNA of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-Œ∫B). The content of tumor necrosis factor-alpha also decreased. MF modulated the apoptotic pathway by suppressing the mRNA of cytochrome c (Cyt c), Fas ligand content, Bax IHC expression, caspase-3 activity and cleaved caspase-3 IHC expression. It also upregulated the expression levels of heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) and B-cell lymphoma 2. Moreover, MF upregulated the mRNA expression levels of HSP70 and c-kit and enriched the content of steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein, which were reflected in serum testosterone levels. This result indicated that MF played crucial roles in steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis. Besides, the activities of testicular marker enzymes, namely, acid and alkaline phosphatases, and lactate dehydrogenase, significantly increased. Histopathological observations provided evidence supporting the biochemical and molecular measurements. In conclusion, MF provided protective mechanisms against the DEHP-mediated deterioration of testicular functions partially through its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties. It also involved the restoration of steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis through the modulation of Nrf2/HO-1, NF-Œ∫B/Cyt c/HSP70, and c-Kit signaling cascades.","Anti-Inflammatory Agents,Antioxidants,NF-E2-Related Factor 2,Nfe2l2 protein, rat,Phosphoproteins,Protective Agents,Steroids,Xanthones,steroidogenic acute regulatory protein,mangiferin,Testosterone,Diethylhexyl Phthalate,Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing),Hmox1 protein, rat","altitude,cortisol,free thyroxine,growth hormone,hypobaric hypoxia,prolactin,thyroid stimulating hormone","Acclimatization,Adaptation, Physiological,Adult,Altitude,Endocrine System,Female,Human Growth Hormone,Humans,Hydrocortisone,Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System,Hypoxia,Mountaineering,Pituitary-Adrenal System,Prolactin,Thyroid Hormones"

In our previous study (Ge et al., 2021), BPA induces DNA damage and apoptosis in Xenopus embryos, resulting in multiple malformations of larvae. However, the signaling pathways induced for apoptosis response to DNA damage are still not well elucidated. Here, we systematically elucidated the enriched pathways affected by BPA and illustrated the interactions of involved proteins. Results indicated that BPA affected multiple embryonic development pathways including Hippo, TGF-Œ≤, Wnt, and Notch pathways. Furthermore, the protein-protein interaction network suggested that the c-Abl/YAP/p73 pathway may play a key role in apoptosis induction in response to DNA damage. P19 embryonal carcinoma stem cells, as a developmental toxicity model, were treated with different BPA concentrations to establish an in vitro model to verify the role of the c-Abl/YAP/p73 pathway in apoptosis. BPA triggered DNA damage and significantly upregulated the expression levels of c-Abl, phosphorylated YAP, phosphorylated p73, and cleaved caspase-3 protein (p\xa0<\xa00.05), thus decreasing cell viability and transcriptionally activating the p73 target genes Bax and Puma.

34214916,-172,Dimethoxyethyl phthalate (DMEP),Cell death,DMEP induces mitochondrial damage regulated by inhibiting Nrf2 and SIRT1/PGC-1Œ± signaling pathways in HepG2 cells.,"Dimethoxyethyl phthalate (DMEP) is an environmental endocrine disruptor. However, research into the underlying mechanisms of DMEP mitochondrial toxicity is still in its infancy. We therefore expect to understand whether DMEP induced mitochondrial damage in HepG2 cells and the associated signaling pathways. DMEP (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2¬†mM) exposure for 48¬†h induced a notable increment in reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in hepG2 cells, resulting in cellular oxidative stress. Low doses of DMEP upregulated nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and downstream protein haeme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) levels and high doses down-regulated their levels. Nrf2 levels increased after ROS scavenging by N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), which indicated that the Nrf2 pathway may be affected by oxidative stress. We also found that DMEP decreased ATP content, mitochondrial copy number (mtDNA), translocase of the outer membrane subunit 20 (TOM20) expression, mitochondria-encoded genes CO1, CO2, CO3, ATP6, ATP8 expression, inhibited mitochondrial biogenesis pathway, down-regulated sirtuin 1(SIRT1), PPAR gamma co-activator 1 alpha (PGC-1Œ±), Nuclear respiratory factor 1(Nrf1), Mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) content and activated PINK1/Parkin autophagy pathway. DMEP also activated the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, causing cytochrome c cytoplasmic translocation and caspase 3 cleavage. What's more, DMEP activated the Nuclear factor-Œ∫B (NF-Œ∫B) pathway and levels of tumor necrosis factor-Œ± (TNF-Œ±), interleukin-1Œ≤ (IL-1Œ≤) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were significantly upregulated, causing an inflammatory response. In summary, DMEP can cause inflammatory response and oxidative stress in HepG2 cells, inhibited the Nrf2 pathway and mitochondrial biogenesis, and induced autophagy and apoptosis. And oxidative stress at least partially affected the Nrf2 pathway and mitochondrial biogenesis SIRT1/PGC-1Œ± pathway.","Endocrine Disruptors,NF-E2-Related Factor 2,NFE2L2 protein, human,PPARGC1A protein, human,Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha,Phthalic Acids,dimethoxyethyl phthalate,SIRT1 protein, human,Sirtuin 1",,"Acoustic Stimulation,Adrenocorticotropic Hormone,Animals,Behavior, Animal,Corticosterone,Disease Models, Animal,Electroshock,Fear,Maternal Deprivation,Mice,Rats,Restraint, Physical,Sleep Deprivation,Social Isolation,Stress, Psychological,Swimming"

It has been used in consumer products and epoxy resins for decades as protective coatings and linings for food and beverage bottles. This can trigger human reactions to BPA which interferes with estrogen receptors. Our study explored the ameliorative effects of selenium (Se) in male rats on liver damage caused by BPA. Rats were divided into four groups at random: The first one obtained olive oil and acted as a control. Se (0.5¬†mg/kg diet) was given for the second group. The third one was treated with BPA (10¬†mg/kg body weight/day) orally. Concomitantly Se (0.5¬†mg/kg diet) and BPA (10¬†mg/kg body weight/day) were given orally in the fourth one. Liver specimens were prepared for light, electron microscopes and the serum samples were screened for biochemical markers. In the BPA received group, histological findings indicated apoptotic hepatic histological changes such as sinusoidal congestion, cytoplasmic vacuolation and leukocyte infiltration. Ultrastructurally, the same group had mitochondrial degeneration, rough endoplasmic reticulum swelling, and nuclear pyknosis, as well as fat droplet deposition and lysosome enhancement. Liver enzymes: In the BPA group, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) have been substantially increased. Moreover, histological and ultrastructural improvements were seen in the rat population treated with BPA and Se, whereas ALT and AST levels were lowered and malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), human C reactive protein (hCRP), and the serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) were significantly modulated. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Bisphenol A (BPA) is used in the manufacturing of polycarbonate plastic (e.g., water bottles, baby bottles) and epoxy resins (e.g., inner coating in metallic food cans). It is a non-polymer preservative for other plastics, one of the contaminants of the atmosphere and a common endocrine estrogenic disruptor.

Recent studies have found that environmental endocrine disruptors play an important role in the regulation of lipid metabolism. Bisphenol A (BPA), a common environmental endocrine disruptor, has adverse effects on lipid metabolism, but the mechanism is still unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of gestational BPA exposure on hepatic lipid metabolism and its possible mechanism in male offspring. The pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to BPA (0, 0.05, 0.5, 5¬†mg/kg/day) from day 5 to day 19 of gestation to investigate the levels of triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC), and the expression of liver lipid metabolism-related genes in male offspring rats. The results showed that compared with the control group, the TG and TC levels in serum and liver in BPA-exposed groups was increased. And the expressions of liver fatty acid oxidation related genes, such as peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor Œ± (PPARŒ±) and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1Œ± (CPT1Œ±), were down-regulated. However, the expressions of fatty acid synthesis related genes, such as sterol regulatory element binding proteins 1 (SREBP-1), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), fatty acid synthase (FAS) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD-1), were up-regulated. The increased protein levels of mTOR and p-CRTC2 suggested that CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2) might be an important mediator in the mTOR/SREBP-1 pathway. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that mTOR/CRTC2/SREBP-1 could be affected by gestational BPA exposure, which may involve in the lipid metabolic disorders in later life.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Fatty Acids,PPAR alpha,Peroxisome Proliferators,Phenols,Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 1,Triglycerides,Cholesterol,Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase,Transferases,Fatty Acid Synthases,mTOR protein, rat,TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases,Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase,bisphenol A,Carnitine","Cancer,Endocrine disruption,Human relevance,Thyroid adenoma,Thyroid carcinoma","Acrylates,Animals,Carcinogens,Dogs,Female,Humans,Male,Mice,Neoplasms, Experimental,Rats,Species Specificity,Stomach,Stomach Neoplasms,Thyroid Gland,Thyroid Hormones,Thyroid Neoplasms,Toxicity Tests, Chronic"

Cadmium-induced inhibition of spermatogenesis is associated with a hormone secretion disorder. Letrozole is an aromatase inhibitor that increases peripheral androgen levels and stimulates spermatogenesis. However, the potential protective effects of letrozole on cadmium-induced reproductive toxicity remain to be elucidated. In this study, male mice were administered CdCl (4\xa0mg/kg BW) orally by gavage alone or in combination with letrozole (0.25\xa0mg/kg BW) for 30\xa0days. Cd exposure caused a significant decreases in body weight, sperm count, motility, vitality, and plasma testosterone levels. Histopathological changes revealed extensive vacuolization and decreased spermatozoa in the lumen. However, in the Cd\u2009+\u2009letrozole group, letrozole treatment compensated for deficits in sperm parameters (count, motility, and vitality) induced by Cd. Letrozole treatment significantly increased serum testosterone levels, which were reduced by Cd. Histopathological studies revealed a systematic array of all germ cells, a preserved basement membrane and relatively less vacuolization. For a mechanistic examination, RNA-seq was used to profile alterations in gene expression in response to letrozole. Compared with that in the Cd-treated group, RNA-Seq analysis showed that 214 genes were differentially expressed in the presence of letrozole. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and KEGG signaling pathway analysis showed that steroid biosynthetic processes were the processes most affected by letrozole treatment. Furthermore, we found that the expression of the testosterone synthesis-related genes LHCGR (luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor) and Hsd3b6 (3 beta- and steroid delta-isomerase 6) was significantly downregulated in Cd-treated testes, but these genes maintained similar expression levels in letrozole-treated testes as those in the control group. However, the transcription levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1Œ≤ and IL-6, and oxidative stress-related genes (Nrf2, Nqo1, and Ho-1) showed no changes.

The structure of the environmental hormone nonylphenol (NP) is very similar to that of estrogen; it binds to the estrogen receptor to produce estrogen-like effects and thus may also bind to the membrane GPER. We explored whether NP administration would reduce the effects of G-1 on AR, the interactions between the two materials, and their mechanisms of action using a murine model of AR. Mice were randomly assigned into control, AR, G-1, and G-1¬†+¬†NP groups (n¬†=¬†10/group). AR nasal symptoms were scored.

Previous studies have investigated the effect of this compound on gonadotrophin secretion and have provided conflicting results. To study further the effect of mifepristone on basal and gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-induced gonadotrophin secretion, 12 normally ovulating women were investigated during two consecutive menstrual cycles, comprising an untreated cycle (control) and a cycle treated with mifepristone. All women were treated with mifepristone on days 2-8 at the dose of 100 mg (group 1, eight women) or 10 mg per day (group 2, six women). Two women were treated with both regimens in two different cycles. On day 8 of both cycles, the women received two GnRH pulses of 10 micrograms each 2 h apart. Blood samples in relation to the first GnRH pulse were taken at-15, 0, 30, 60, 120, 150, 180 and 240 min. In group 1, the increase in luteinizing hormone (delta LH) in response to GnRH was significantly attenuated from 30 to 180 min, while the increase in follicle stimulating hormone (delta FSH) was attenuated only in response to the second GnRH pulse. No significant decrease in delta LH and delta FSH response to GnRH was seen during treatment with the 10 mg dose (group 2). In group 1, serum oestradiol and inhibin-A concentrations after day 8 were lower than in the control cycles and the LH peak was postponed by 7 days on average. Basal LH values increased significantly on day 8 in both groups, while FSH values did not change significantly compared with the control cycles. A significant increase in serum progesterone and cortisol values occurred during the treatment only in group 1. Mid-luteal values of inhibin-A were significantly lower in cycles treated with 100 mg mifepristone than in the control cycles. We conclude that the disruption of folliculogenesis by mifepristone cannot be explained by a decrease in basal FSH concentrations during the critical period of follicle recruitment and selection. It is possible that mifepristone exerts its effect at the level of the ovary. It is also suggested that progesterone during the follicular phase of the cycle may participate in the control of the self-priming action of GnRH on the pituitary.","Hormone Antagonists,Mifepristone,Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone,Progesterone,Estradiol,Luteinizing Hormone,Follicle Stimulating Hormone,Hydrocortisone",,"Action Potentials,Animals,Basolateral Nuclear Complex,Behavior, Animal,Conditioning, Classical,Dendritic Spines,Endocrine System,Estrous Cycle,Extinction, Psychological,Fear,Female,Golgi Apparatus,Male,Neurons,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Stress, Psychological"

In particular, during early pregnancy, any adverse exposure may cause abnormal fetal growth or inhibit the development of embryogenic organs. The potential risks of phthalate exposure, which affects the development of humans and animals, are becoming a serious concern worldwide. However, the specific molecular mechanism of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP)-induced cardiotoxicity in fetal mice remains unclear. In this study, animal models of DEHP gavage at concentrations of 250, 500, and 1000¬†mg/kg/day within 8.5-18.5 days of pregnancy were established. The cell proliferation, survival, and apoptosis rates were evaluated using CCK8, EdU, TUNEL and flow cytometry. The molecular mechanism was assessed via transcriptome sequencing, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and Western blot analysis. In vivo, DEHP increased apoptosis, decreased Ki67 and CD31 expression, reduced heart weight and area, slowed down myocardial sarcomere development, and caused cardiac septal defect in fetal mice heart. Transcriptome sequencing showed that DEHP decreased NRG1 expression and downregulated the ErbB2/ErbB4-PI3K/AKT signaling pathway-related target genes. In vitro, primary cardiomyocytes were cultured with DEHP at a concentration of 150¬†Œºg/mL combined with ErbB inhibitor (AG1478, 10 Œºmol/L) and/or NRG1 protein (100¬†ng/mL) for 72¬†h. After DEHP intervention, the expression of NRG1 and the phosphorylation level of ErbB2, ErbB4, PI3K, and AKT decreased, and the apoptosis-related protein levels increased. Moreover, the apoptosis rate increased. After adding exogenous NRG1, the phosphorylation level of the NRG1/ERbB2/ERbB4-PI3K/AKT pathway increased, and the apoptosis-related protein levels decreased. Further, the apoptosis rate reduced. Interestingly, after exposure to DEHP and AG1478¬†+¬†NRG1, the anti-apoptotic effect of NRG1 and cardiomyocyte proliferation decreased by inhibiting the NRG1/ERbB2/ERbB4-PI3K/AKT pathway. Hence, the NRG1-dependent regulation of the ERbB2/ERbB4-PI3K/AKT signaling pathway may be a key mechanism of DEHP-induced myocardial cytotoxicity.","NRG1 protein, human,Neuregulin-1,Nrg1 protein, mouse,Phthalic Acids,phthalic acid,Diethylhexyl Phthalate,ERBB2 protein, human,ERBB4 protein, human,Erbb4 protein, mouse,Receptor, ErbB-2,Receptor, ErbB-4,Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt","Cypermethrin,Sertoli cell,apoptosis,endoplasmic reticulum pathway,male reproductive toxicity","Activating Transcription Factor 4,Animals,Apoptosis,Endoplasmic Reticulum,Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2,Male,Mice,Pyrethrins,Sertoli Cells,Signal Transduction,eIF-2 Kinase"

35534961,-166,Decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209),Reproductive,Transgenerational effects of BDE-209 on male reproduction in F3 offspring rats.,"Decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209), a congener of polybrominated diphenyl ethers, is a commonly used brominated flame retardant and a known endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC). Knowledge about the effects of prenatal BDE-209 exposure on male reproduction and whether transgenerational effects occur in subsequent generations are scant. Therefore, in this study, we tested the hypothesis that prenatal exposure to BDE-209 disrupted sperm function in the F1, F2, and F3 generations of male rats. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were treated by gavage from gestation day 0 to birth with 5¬†mg BDE-209/kg/day. This treatment was based on the lowest-observed-adverse-effect level for DNA damage to sperm in male offspring. On postnatal day 84 for all generations, epididymal sperm counts, motility, morphology, reactive oxygen species generation, sperm chromatin DNA structure integrity, testicular DNA content in spermatogenesis, and serum testosterone levels were assessed. DNA methyltransferase (Dnmts) mRNA expression and methyl-CpG binding domain sequencing were also examined to analyze DNA methylation status in the F3 generation. In the F1 generation, prenatal exposure to BDE-209 disrupted body weight, decreased anogenital distance (AGD), sperm count, and motility; and increased bent tail rates of sperm. In the F2 generation, exposure to BDE-209 decreased AGD, sperm count, normal morphology rates, Dnmt1 expression, and increased Dnmt3a expression. In the F3 generation, BDE-209 exposure decreased AGD and normal sperm morphology, disrupted testicular elongated spermatid and round spermatid rates, reduced serum testosterone levels, and inhibited the mRNA expression of Dnmt1 and Dnmt3b. Compared with the control group, there existed 215 differentially hyper-methylated and 83 hypo-methylated genes in the BDE-209 group. BDE-209 is an EDC to disrupt the male reproduction from F1 to F3. BDE-209-induced changes in sperm function and hyper- or hypo-DNA methylation in the F3 generation might therefore explain the possible mechanism underlying BDE-209-mediated epigenetic transgenerational effects on the male reproductive system.","Endocrine Disruptors,Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers,RNA, Messenger,Testosterone,DNA,decabromobiphenyl ether","Adipogenesis,Bisphenol,Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs),High content screening,Mesenchymal stem cell,Obesity","Adaptation, Biological,Adipocytes,Adipogenesis,Benzhydryl Compounds,Cell Differentiation,High-Throughput Screening Assays,Humans,Mesenchymal Stem Cells,Phenols"

Fetal and perinatal endocrine disruption reportedly affects germ cell nests (GCN) breakdown, meiosis, and primordial follicle (PF) assembly with unassembled oocytes in neonatal ovaries. We recently reported that very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs) and ovarian stem cells (OSCs) express ERŒ±, ERŒ≤ and FSHR, undergo distinct cyclic changes and neo-oogenesis encompassing GCN formation, meiosis, and primordial follicle (PF) assembly on regular basis in adult mice ovaries and these GCN are arrested in pre-meiotic or early meiotic stage in aged ovaries. Present study was undertaken to evaluate whether neonatal exposure to endocrine disruption (estradiol E2 or diethylstilbestrol DES) affects ovarian stem cells and their differentiation (neo-oogenesis) and PF assembly in adult 100 days old ovaries. Neonatal exposure to E2 resulted in typical features of PCOS including hyperandrogenism, infertility, increased stromal compartment, absent corpus lutea, and cystic follicles whereas DES treated ovaries showed rapid recruitment of follicles in young ovaries and multi-ovular/cystic follicles. Ovary surface epithelial cells smears showed large numbers of growth-arrested GCN in zygotene/pachytene with increased expression of Mlh-1 and Scp-1 suggesting defects at synapsis and recombination stages during prophase-1 of meiosis. Being immortal and expression of ERŒ± and ERŒ≤ makes VSELs directly vulnerable to carry developmental endocrine insults to adult life. Dysfunction of VSELs/OSCs possibly results in oocyte defects observed¬†in our study in PCOS/POI besides the widely reported defects in granulosa cells.","Estrogen Receptor alpha,Estrogen Receptor beta",,"Adaptation, Physiological,Adaptation, Psychological,Cardiovascular Diseases,Circadian Rhythm,Cognition Disorders,Humans,Melatonin,Mental Disorders,Mental Health,Metabolic Diseases,Neoplasms,Social Behavior,Stress, Psychological,Work Schedule Tolerance"

Epidemiological studies have found that the exposure of DEHP and BPA could increase the susceptibility to thyroid diseases including thyroid cancer and benign thyroid nodules. Due to the existence of multiple pollutants in our daily life, the mixed toxic effects of exposure and their interrelationships may distinguish from the exposure to a single chemical, so it is of great significance to explore the mixed toxic effect of DEHP and BPA co-exposure. Thyroid, as one of the target organs of EDCs, is prone to tumor occurrence, however, whether the mixture of BPA and DEHP will affect the occurrence of thyroid cancer is still obscure. We aim to investigate the effect of single or combined exposure to BPA and DEHP on the occurrence of thyroid cancer. An animal model of exposure to BPA and DEHP was firstly established to evaluate their effect on DMD-induced thyroid cancer. Additionally, human thyroid cancer cells BCPAP and thyroid cells Nthy-ori3-1 were used to further clarify some possible mechanisms of BPA and MEHP, the main metabolite of DEHP. Consequently, we found that BPA alone could increase the incidence of thyroid tumors in female rats compared with DEHP, and DEHP enhanced the effect of BPA on cancer promotion. BPA alone and in combination with DEHP mainly induced the expression of HDAC6, inhibited tumor suppressor gene PTEN upregulated the expression of oncogene c-MYC, and eventually elevate the susceptibility to thyroid tumors. Mechanistically, BPA alone and in combination with MEHP could significantly induce the proliferation of BCPAP cells depending on HDAC6, which could modulate H3K9ac to inhibit PTEN, activate AKT signaling pathway, and simultaneously upregulate the expression of c-MYC. Interestingly, we found that BPA alone and in combination with MEHP could significantly induce the proliferation of Nthy-ori3-1 cells independent on HDAC6 via activating ERK signaling pathway. Taken together, these findings not only provide new evidence of the promoting effect of BPA and DEHP on thyroid cancer but also discusses some possible mechanisms underlying these effects.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Phenols,Phthalic Acids,phthalic acid,Diethylhexyl Phthalate,PTEN Phosphohydrolase,Pten protein, rat,HDAC6 protein, rat,Histone Deacetylase 6,bisphenol A","gestational diabetes,glucose metabolism,insulin resistance,placental endocrine function,pregnancy,sex dimorphism","Adaptation, Physiological,Diabetes, Gestational,Endocrine System,Female,Fetus,Glucose,Humans,Insulin,Insulin Resistance,Male,Placenta,Pregnancy,Sex Factors"

Hence, the aim of this work was to investigate the effect of the exposure of EDCS 17Œ±-ethynylestradiol (EE), diethyl phthalate (DEP) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) on RACK1 expression and on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced activation of the human monocytic cell line THP-1, a validated model for this investigation. In line with our previous results with estrogen-active compounds, EE treatment significantly induced RACK1 promoter transcriptional activity, mRNA expression, and protein levels, which paralleled an increase in LPS-induced IL-8, TNF-Œ± production and CD86 expression, previously demonstrated to be dependent on RACK1/PKCŒ≤ activation. EE mediates its effect on RACK1 expression through G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) and androgen receptor (AR) ligand-independent cascade, as also suggested by in silico molecular docking simulation. Conversely, DEP and PFOS induced a dose-dependent downregulation of RACK1 promoter transcriptional activity, mRNA expression, and protein levels, which was mirrored by a reduction of IL-8, TNF-Œ± production and CD86 expression. Mifepristone pre-treatments abolish DEP and PFOS effects, confirming their GR agonist profile, also corroborated by molecular docking.

The effects of chlorpyrifos exposure on serum hormone levels, proinflammatory cytokines and gut microbiota were evaluated. Chronic exposure to chlorpyrifos significantly decreased the concentrations of luteinizing hormone, follicule stimulating hormone and testosterone, which was found only in the normal-fat diet. The counteracted effect of high-fat diet was also found in gut hormones and proinflammatory cytokines. Significantly higher concentrations of glucagon-like peptide-1, pancreatic polypeptide, peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY), ghrelin, gastric inhibitory poly-peptide, IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and TNF-Œ± were found in rats exposed to chlorpyrifos beginning at newly weaned, whereas only the PYY, ghrelin and IL-6 concentrations increased significantly in rats exposed in adulthood.

32960947,-159,Bisphenol A,Neurological,BPA Differentially Regulates NPY Expression in Hypothalamic Neurons Through a Mechanism Involving Oxidative Stress.,"Bisphenol A (BPA), a ubiquitous endocrine-disrupting chemical, interferes with reproduction and is also considered an obesogen. The neuropeptide Y (NPY) neurons of the hypothalamus control both food intake and reproduction and have emerged as potential targets of BPA. These functionally diverse subpopulations of NPY neurons are differentially regulated by peripheral signals, such as estrogen and leptin. Whether BPA also differentially alters Npy expression in subpopulations of NPY neurons, contributing to BPA-induced endocrine dysfunction is unclear. We investigated the response of 6 immortalized hypothalamic NPY-expressing cell lines to BPA treatment. BPA upregulated Npy mRNA expression in 4 cell lines (mHypoA-59, mHypoE-41, mHypoA-2/12, mHypoE-42), and downregulated Npy in 2 lines (mHypoE-46, mHypoE-44). This differential expression of Npy occurred concurrently with differential expression of estrogen receptor mRNA levels. Inhibition of G-protein coupled estrogen receptor GPR30 or estrogen receptor Œ≤ prevented the BPA-mediated decrease in Npy, whereas inhibition of energy sensor 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) with compound C prevented BPA-induced increase in Npy. BPA also altered neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress markers in both mHypoA-59 and mHypoE-46 cell lines despite the differential regulation of Npy. Remarkably, treatment with BPA in an antioxidant-rich media, Neurobasal A (NBA), or with reactive oxygen species scavenger tauroursodeoxycholic acid mitigated the BPA-induced increase and decrease in Npy. Furthermore, 2 antioxidant species from NBA-N-acetylcysteine and vitamin B6-diminished the induction of Npy in the mHypoA-59 cells, demonstrating these supplements can counteract BPA-induced dysregulation in certain subpopulations. Overall, these results illustrate the differential regulation of Npy by BPA in neuronal subpopulations, and point to oxidative stress as a pathway that can be targeted to block BPA-induced Npy dysregulation in hypothalamic neurons.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Esr1 protein, mouse,Estrogen Receptor alpha,Neuropeptide Y,Phenols,bisphenol A","Adipocyte dysfunction,Adipocytes,Adipose tissue,Extracellular vesicles,Obesity,Vascular inflammation","Adipocytes,Adipose Tissue,Extracellular Vesicles,Humans,Inflammation,Obesity"

Ethinyl estradiol (EE2) is a synthetic estrogen used in contraceptive pills, whereas zearalenone (ZEA) is a natural mycoestrogen found with increasing prevalence in various cereal crops. Both EE2 and ZEA are agonists of estrogen receptor-Œ± and accelerate puberty. However, the neuroendocrine mechanisms that are responsible for this effect remain unknown. Immature female Wistar rats were treated with EE2 (10 Œºg/kg), ZEA (10 mg/kg), or vehicle for 10 days starting from postnatal day 18. As a marker of puberty, the vaginal opening was recorded and neuropeptide and related transcription factor mRNA levels were measured by quantitative real time PCR and in situ hybridization histochemistry. Both ZEA and EE2 accelerated the vaginal opening, increased the uterine weight and the number of antral follicles in the ovary, and resulted in the increased central expression of gnrh. These changes occurred in parallel with an earlier increase of kiss1 mRNA in the anteroventral and rostral periventricular hypothalamus and an increased kisspeptin (KP) fiber density and KP-GnRH appositions in the preoptic area. These changes are compatible with a mechanism in which xenoestrogens overstimulate the developmentally unprepared reproductive system, which results in an advanced vaginal opening and an enlargement of the uterus at the periphery. Within the hypothalamus, ZEA and EE2 directly activate anteroventral and periventricular KP neurons to stimulate GnRH mRNA.

BPAF showed extreme cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner (LC =0.014\xa0ŒºM (rASCs) and 0.009\xa0ŒºM (hMSCs)), whereas TMBPF showed a bimodal response, with low and high concentrations being the most toxic (LC =0.88\xa0ŒºM (rASCs) and 0.06\xa0ŒºM (hMSCs)). Activated caspase-6 levels increased in nearly all cells treated with the BPA analogs indicating the majority of cell death was due to caspase-6-mediated apoptosis. These results in both rat and human stem cells underscore the toxicity and potency of these BPA analogs, and establish a rank order of potency of: BPAF>TMBPF>BPA>BPS. Further, these and other recent findings indicate that these newer BPA analogs may be \'regrettable substitutions,\' being worse than the original parent compound and lacking proper testing and regulation.

These findings were further demonstrated by an  model of PBDE-47-treated PC12 cells. Mechanistically, autophagy alteration is more sensitive to PBDE-47 treatment than apoptosis induction. Importantly, while stimulation of autophagy by the chemical inducer rapamycin and adenovirus-mediated  overexpression aggravated PBDE-47-induced apoptosis and cell death, inhibition of autophagy by the chemical inhibitor wortmannin and siRNA knockdown of  reversed PBDE-47-produced detrimental outcomes.

Di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), a plasticizer to which humans are exposed daily, can trigger reproductive toxicity by acting as an endocrine-disrupting chemical. In mammals, the female primordial follicle pool forms the lifetime available ovarian reserve, which does not undergo regeneration once it is established during the fetal and neonatal period. It is therefore critical to examine the toxicity of DEHP regarding the establishment of the ovarian reserve as it has not been well investigated.  The ovarian cells of postnatal pups, following maternal DEHP exposure, were prepared for single cell-RNA sequencing, and the effects of DEHP on primordial follicle formation were revealed using gene differential expression analysis and single-cell developmental trajectory. In addition, further biochemical experiments, including immunohistochemical staining, apoptosis detection, and Western blotting, were performed to verify the dataset results.  Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we revealed the gene expression dynamics of female germ cells and granulosa cells following exposure to DEHP in mice. Regarding germ cells: DEHP impeded the progression of follicle assembly and interfered with their developmental status, while key genes such as ,  and others, strongly evidenced the reduction. As for granulosa cells: DEHP likely inhibited their proliferative activity, and activated the regulation of cell death. Furthermore, the interaction between ovarian cells mediated by transforming growth factor-beta signaling, was disrupted by DEHP exposure, since the expression of GDF9, BMPR1A, and SMAD3 was affected. In addition, DNA damage and apoptosis were elevated in germ cells and/or somatic cells.

Most people encounter BPA in their daily routines. However, it has been heavily reported that BPA has a neurotoxic effect. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of lycopene on cognitive deficits induced by a high dose of BPA focusing on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and memory retrieval in adult male rats. Therefore, 72 rats were divided into four groups: control group, BPA group (50 mg/kg body weight (bw)) 3 days a week for 42 days, lycopene group (10 mg/kg bw) daily for 42 days, and lycopene + BPA group. Concurrent treatment of lycopene with BPA improved the learning and cognition memory in Morris water maze and novel object recognition tests along with an increase in acetylcholine esterase activity as well as inhibition of oxidative stress by restoring reduced glutathione and suppressing malondialdehyde hippocampal level to their normal levels. Mechanistically, lycopene upregulated the protein expression of tyrosine receptor kinase B, which resulted in an upsurge in its downstream cascades MAPK/ERK1/2/cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)/brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling pathway in the hippocampus of BPA-intoxicated rats. Furthermore, concurrent treatment of lycopene with BPA prevented apoptosis by marked decrease in Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) gene expression and caspase 3 activity while restoring B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) gene expression. In conclusion, the present study provided evidence that lycopene exerted a neuroprotective effect against BPA intoxication in hippocampi of rats via its antioxidant properties, activation of MAPK/ERK pathway, and inhibiting a neuronal apoptosis which reflected on improving the learning and cognition memory.","Bdnf protein, rat,Benzhydryl Compounds,Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor,CREB1 protein, rat,Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein,Endocrine Disruptors,Neuroprotective Agents,Phenols,Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2,Ntrk2 protein, rat,Receptor, trkB,Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases,bisphenol A,Lycopene","Anovulation,Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone,Hyperandrogenism,Insulin resistance,Polycystic ovary syndrome,Visceral adiposity","Adipose Tissue,Androgens,Animals,Anovulation,Female,Humans,Inositol,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome"

Manufacturers have begun using 'BPA-free' alternatives instead of BPA in many consumer products. However, these alternatives have had much less testing and oversight, yet they are already being mass-produced and used across industries from plastics to food-contact coatings. Here, we used human female adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs), a type of adult mesenchymal stem cell, to compare the effects of BPA and BPA alternatives on adipogenesis or fat cell development . We focused on two commonly used BPA replacements, bisphenol AF (BPAF) and tetramethyl bisphenol F (TMBPF; monomer of the new valPure V70 food-contact coating). Human ASCs were differentiated into adipocytes using chemically defined media in the presence of control differentiation media with and without 17Œ≤-estradiol (E2; 10 ŒºM), or with increasing doses of BPA (0, 0.1 and 1 ŒºM), BPAF (0, 0.1, 1 and 10 nM), or TMBPF (0, 0.01 and 0.1 ŒºM). After differentiation, the cells were stained and imaged to visualize and quantify the accumulation of lipid vacuoles and number of developing fat cells. Treated cells were also examined for cell viability and apoptosis (programmed cell death) using the respective cellular assays. Similar to E2, BPA at 0.1 ŒºM and BPAF at 0.1 nM, significantly increased adipogenesis and lipid production by 20% compared to control differentiated cells (based on total lipid vacuole number to cell number ratios), whereas higher levels of BPA and BPAF significantly decreased adipogenesis ( < 0.005). All tested doses of TMBPF significantly reduced adipogenesis and lipid production by 30-40%, likely at least partially through toxic effects on stem cells, as viable cell numbers decreased and apoptosis levels increased throughout differentiation. These findings indicate that low, environmentally-relevant doses of BPA, BPAF, and TMBPF have significant effects on fat cell development and lipid accumulation, with TMBPF having non-estrogenic, anti-adipogenic effects.

However, associations between phthalates and environmental phenols are often inconsistent across different populations. In this study, we recruited the adult population (n¬†=¬†3782) of the Korean National Environmental Health Survey (KoNEHS) 2015-2017 (Cycle 3) and assessed the associations between urinary biomarkers of phthalate, BPA, and paraben exposure with obesity and DM. A potential collider issue with the use of urinary creatinine (Cr) or specific gravity (SG) exists when adjusting urinary dilution; therefore, a covariate-adjusted standardization (CAS) was employed for adjustment, and the results were compared. In the present population, the direction of the association often varied depending on the choices made to adjust urinary dilution. When using CAS, the direction of association resembled those of previously reported experimental observations. With Cr or SG adjustment, ORs for obesity decreased in the highest quartiles of monocarboxyoctyl phthalate (MCOP) [OR (95% CI)¬†=¬†Cr: 0.71 (0.54, 0.93); SG: 0.68 (0.52, 0.90)], monocarboxy-isononyl phthalate (MCNP) [OR (95% CI)¬†=¬†Cr: 0.67 (0.52, 0.87); SG: 0.68 (0.52, 0.89)], and mono(3-carboxylpropyl) phthalate (MCPP) in the urine [OR (95% CI)¬†=¬†Cr: 0.60 (0.47, 0.76); SG: 0.61 (0.48, 0.77)]; however, with CAS, these negative associations disappeared. Instead, mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP) [OR (95% CI)¬†=¬†1.31 (1.03, 1.66)], BPA [OR (95% CI)¬†=¬†1.62 (1.27, 2.06)], or ethyl paraben (EtP) [OR (95% CI)¬†=¬†1.51 (1.19, 1.91)] concentrations in the highest quartile showed positive associations with a higher risk of obesity. On the other hand, for DM, an overall decrease in ORs was observed for phthalate metabolites and BPA following SG adjustment and disappeared with CAS adjustment. In addition, the highest quartiles of BPA, methyl paraben (MeP), and ethyl paraben (EtP) showed a significantly higher risk of DM than those in the lowest quartiles following CAS [OR (95% CI)¬†=¬†BPA: 1.65 (1.06, 2.59); MeP: 1.68 (1.08, 2.60); and EtP: 2.74 (1.77, 4.24), respectively].

We aimed to test the hypothesis that developmental exposure of California mice (Peromyscus californicus) to GEN, BPA, or both chemicals influences hypothalamic miR/small RNA profiles and ascertain the extent such biomolecular alterations correlate with behavioral and metabolic changes. California mice were developmentally exposed to GEN (250 mg/kg feed weight, FW), GEN (250 mg/kg FW)+BPA (5 mg/kg FW), low dose (LD) BPA (5 mg/kg FW), or upper dose (UD) BPA (50 mg/kg FW). Adult offspring were tested in a battery of behavioral and metabolic tests; whereupon, mice were euthanized, brains were collected and frozen, small RNAs were isolated from hypothalamic punches, and subsequently sequenced. California mice exposed to one or both EDCs engaged in one or more repetitive behaviors. GEN, LD BPA, and UD BPA altered aspects of ultrasonic and audible vocalizations. Each EDC exposure led to sex-dependent differences in differentially expressed miR/small RNAs with miR7-2, miR146, and miR148a being increased in all female and male EDC exposed groups. Current findings reveal that developmental exposure to GEN and/or BPA affects hypothalamic miR/small RNA expression patterns, and such changes correlate with EDC-induced behavioral and metabolic alterations. miR146 is likely an important mediator and biomarker of EDC exposure in mammals, including humans.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,MicroRNAs",,"Adipose Tissue,Animals,Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2,Humans,Metabolic Syndrome,Obesity,Regional Blood Flow,Sympathetic Nervous System"

Thereby it contaminates fruit products prepared for human consumption. Genistein-containing soy products are increasingly used as food additives with health-promoting properties. Therefore we examined the effects of long-term dietary administration (3 months) of the anti-androgen procymidone (26.4 mg/animal per day) or the phytoestrogen genistein (21.1 mg/animal per day) to rats on the pituitary-gonadal axis in vivo, as well as on Leydig cell steroidogenesis and on spermatogenesis ex vivo. The procymidone-containing diet elevated serum levels of LH and testosterone and, furthermore, Leydig cells isolated from procymidone-treated animals displayed an enhanced capacity for producing testosterone in response to stimulation by hCG or dibutyryl cAMP, as well as elevated expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage (P450 scc) and cytochrome P450 17alpha (P450c17). In contrast, the rate of DNA synthesis during stages VIII and IX of spermatogenesis in segments of seminiferous tubules isolated from genistein-treated rats was decreased without accompanying changes in the serum level of either LH or testosterone. Nonetheless, genistein did suppress the ex vivo steroidogenic response of Leydig cells to hCG or dibutyryl cAMP by down-regulating their expression of P450 scc. Considered together, our present findings demonstrate that long-term dietary administration of procymidone or genistein to rats exerts different effects on the pituitary-gonadal axis in vivo and on Leydig cell steroidogenesis ex vivo. Possibly as a result of disruption of hormonal feedback control due to its anti-androgenic action, procymidone activates this endocrine axis, thereby causing hyper-gonadotropic activation of testicular steroidogenesis. In contrast, genistein influences spermatogenesis and significantly inhibits Leydig cell steroidogenesis ex vivo without altering the serum level of either LH or testosterone.","Androgen Antagonists,Bridged Bicyclo Compounds,Fungicides, Industrial,Phytoestrogens,Testosterone,Luteinizing Hormone,Genistein,procymidone","endocrine,gene,growth hormone,insulin,metabolism,tissue","Adipose Tissue,Animals,Islets of Langerhans,Liver,Macrophages,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Muscles,Phenotype,Receptors, Somatotropin"

34954075,-153,Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP),"Genetic, Reproductive",Prenatal exposure to the phthalate DEHP impacts reproduction-related gene expression in the pituitary.,"Phthalates are chemicals used in products including plastics, personal care products, and building materials, leading to widespread contact. Previous studies on prenatal exposure to Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) in mice and humans demonstrated pubertal timing and reproductive performance could be affected in exposed offspring. However, the impacts at the pituitary, specifically regarding signaling pathways engaged and direct effects on the gonadotropins LH and FSH, are unknown. We hypothesized prenatal exposure to DEHP during a critical period of embryonic development (e15.5 to e18.5) will cause sex-specific disruptions in reproduction-related mRNA expression in offspring's pituitary due to interference with androgen and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling. We found that prenatal DEHP exposure in vivo caused a significant increase in Fshb specifically in males, while the anti-androgen flutamide caused significant increases in both Lhb and Fshb in males. AhR target gene Cyp1b1 was increased in both sexes in DEHP-exposed offspring. In embryonic pituitary cultures, the DEHP metabolite MEHP increased Cyp1a1 and Cyp1b1 mRNA in both sexes and Cyp1b1 induction was reduced by co-treatment with AhR antagonist. AhR reporter assay in GHFT1 cells confirmed MEHP can activate AhR signaling. Lhb, Fshb and Gnrhr mRNA were significantly decreased in both sexes by MEHP, but co-treatment with AhR antagonist did not restore mRNA levels in pituitary culture. In summary, our data suggest phthalates can directly affect the function of the pituitary by activating AhR signaling and altering gonadotropin expression. This indicates DEHP's impacts on the pituitary could contribute to reproductive dysfunctions observed in exposed mice and humans.","Follicle Stimulating Hormone, beta Subunit,Luteinizing Hormone, beta Subunit,Plasticizers,Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon,Diethylhexyl Phthalate,Cyp1b1 protein, mouse,Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1,Cytochrome P-450 CYP1B1",,"Administration, Inhalation,Animals,Female,Gonadal Steroid Hormones,Hyaluronoglucosaminidase,Luteinizing Hormone,Male,Pregnancy,Rats,Rats, Inbred F344,Spermatogenesis,Testis,Vehicle Emissions"

They affect the vasopressinergic system but their disruptive mechanisms are not well understood. Our group reported that rats perinatally exposed to Aroclor-1254 (A1254) and DE-71 (commercial mixtures of PCBs and PBDEs) decrease somatodendritic vasopressin (AVP) release while increasing plasma AVP responses to osmotic activation, potentially emptying AVP reserves required for body-water balance. The aim of this research was to evaluate the effects of perinatal exposure to A1254 or DE-71 (30mgkg/day) on AVP transcription and protein content in the paraventricular and supraoptic hypothalamic nuclei, of male and female rats, by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. cFOS mRNA expression was evaluated in order to determine neuroendocrine cells activation due to osmotic stimulation. Animal groups were: vehicle (control); exposed to either A1254 or DE-71; both, control and exposed, subjected to osmotic challenge. The results confirmed a physiological increase in AVP-immunoreactivity (AVP-IR) and gene expression in response to osmotic challenge as reported elsewhere. In contrast, the exposed groups did not show this response to osmotic activation, they showed significant reduction in AVP-IR neurons, and AVP mRNA expression as compared to the hyperosmotic controls. cFOS mRNA expression increased in A1254 dehydrated groups, suggesting that the AVP-IR decrease was not due to a lack of the response to the osmotic activation. Therefore, A1254 may interfere with the activation of AVP mRNA transcript levels and protein, causing a central dysfunction of vasopressinergic system.","Environmental Pollutants,Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers,Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos,RNA, Messenger,Chlorodiphenyl (54% Chlorine),Arginine Vasopressin,Sodium Chloride,pentabromodiphenyl ether",,"Administration, Oral,Animals,Atrazine,Body Weight,Estrogen Antagonists,Estrogens,Female,Organ Size,Ovariectomy,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Receptors, Progesterone,Simazine,Uterus"

The uptake of microplastic-derived plasticizers by marine animals and the subsequent entry in the food chain raises concerns for adverse health effects in human beings. Frequently used plasticizers as the organophosphate ester tri-o-cresyl phosphate (TOCP) are known to affect the male reproductive system. However, the overall endocrine potential of TOCP and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive as yet. In this study, we investigated the molecular effects of TOCP on estrogen receptor Œ± (ERŒ±)-transfected HEK-ESR1 cells and the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Applying virtual screening and molecular docking, we identified TOCP as potent ligand of ERŒ± in silico. Microscale thermophoresis confirmed the binding in vitro with similar intensity as the natural ligand 17-Œ≤-estradiol. To identify the molecular mechanisms of TOCP-mediated effects, we used next-generation sequencing to analyze the gene expression pattern of TOCP-treated MCF-7 cells. RNA-sequencing revealed 22 differently expressed genes associated with ESR1 as upstream regulator: CYP1A1, SLC7A11, RUNX2, DDIT4, STC2, KLHL24, CCNG2, CEACAM5, SLC7A2, MAP1B, SLC7A5, IGF1R, CD55, FOSL2, VEGFA, and HSPA13 were upregulated and PRKCD, CCNE1, CEBPA, SFPQ, TNFAIP2, KRT19 were downregulated. The affected genes promote tumor growth by increasing angiogenesis and nutritional supply, favor invasion and metastasis, and interfere with the cell cycle.

32628958,-152,di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP),Hepatic,Multi and transgenerational epigenetic effects of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) in liver.,"Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), a ubiquitous industrial pollutant, is a known endocrine disrupter implicated in metabolic diseases. Prenatal DEHP exposure promotes epigenetic multi- and transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease in subsequent generations (F1-F3). However, the epigenetic toxicity is less understood in the liver. In this study, CD-1 mice were prenatally exposed to 20¬†Œºg/kg/day, 200¬†Œºg/kg/day, 500¬†mg/kg/day, or 750¬†mg/kg/day DEHP from gestational day (GD) 10.5 until birth of pups. Following prenatal exposure, the multigenerational and transgenerational effects of mRNA expression of epigenetic regulators were evaluated in F1, F2, and F3 generation mouse livers at postnatal days (PNDs) 8 and 60. Results showed that DEHP exposed mice livers exhibited significant changes in global DNA methylation levels in all three generations, with the effect being different in F2 after high dosage exposure. Histopathology indicated that DEHP exposure could induce mild damage in F1 livers. The expression levels of DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) were significantly changed in both the F1 and F2 generations at PND 8, suggesting that maintenance Dnmt1 plays a major role in the multigenerational effect that occur in the early developmental stages. Additionally, DEHP exposure caused significant changes in ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine (Tet) dioxygenases encoding Tet1 expression in all three generations and Tet2 expression in F3 at PND 60, implicating their contributions in inducing both multi- and transgenerational effects after DEHP exposure in mouse liver. Overall, our results establish that prenatal and ancestral DEHP exposure are critical for epigenetic regulation of DNA methylation in female mouse livers.","DNA-Binding Proteins,Endocrine Disruptors,Proto-Oncogene Proteins,Diethylhexyl Phthalate,Dioxygenases,Tet2 protein, mouse,DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases",,"Adolescent,Adult,Age Factors,Aged,Aging,Child,Child, Preschool,Circadian Rhythm,Female,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,Seasons,Suprachiasmatic Nucleus,Vasopressins"

This study addresses the data gap in our knowledge regarding transgenerational transmission of the disruptive interaction between a high-fat diet and endocrine disruptor bisphenol A (BPA). F0 generation Sprague-Dawley rats were fed diets containing butterfat (10 kcal%) and high in butterfat (39 kcal%, HFB) with or without BPA (25 ¬µg/kg body weight/day) during mating and pregnancy. Gestationally exposed F1-generation offspring from different litters were mated to produce F2 offspring, and similarly, F2-generation animals produced F3-generation offspring. One group of F3 male offspring was administered either testosterone plus estradiol-17Œ≤ (T + E2) or sham via capsule implants from postnatal days 70 to 210. Another group was naturally aged to 18 months. Combination diets of HFB + BPA in F0 dams, but not single exposure to either, disrupted spermatogenesis in F3-generation adult males in both the T + E2-implanted group and the naturally aged group. CYP19A1 localization to the acrosome and estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) localization to the nucleus were associated with impaired spermatogenesis. Finally, expression of methyl-CpG-binding domain-3 (MBD3) was consistently decreased in the HFB and HFB + BPA exposed F1 and F3 testes, suggesting an epigenetic component to this inheritance. However, the severe atrophy within testes present in F1 males was absent in F3 males. In conclusion, the HFB + BPA group demonstrated transgenerational inheritance of the impaired spermatogenesis phenotype, but severity was reduced in the F3 generation.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Dietary Fats,Endocrine Disruptors,Phenols,Estradiol,Butter,bisphenol A",,"Adolescent,Adult,Age Factors,Blood Chemical Analysis,Calibration,Female,Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry,Humans,Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated,Limit of Detection,Male,Middle Aged,Pesticides,Sex Factors,Solid Phase Microextraction,Young Adult"

This study aimed to elucidate the epigenetically regulatory mechanism of nicotine on placental 11Œ≤-HSD2 expression. Pregnant Wistar rats were administered 1.0‚ÄØmg/kg nicotine subcutaneously twice a day from gestational day 9 to 20. The results showed that prenatal nicotine exposure increased corticosterone levels in the placenta and fetal serum, disrupted placental morphology and endocrine function, and reduced fetal bodyweight. Meanwhile, histone modification abnormalities (decreased acetylation and increased di-methylation of histone 3 Lysine 9) on the HSD11B2 promoter and lower-expression of 11Œ≤-HSD2 were observed. Furthermore, the expression of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) Œ±4/Œ≤2, the phosphorylation of extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and Ets-like protein-1 (Elk-1), and the expression of early growth response-1 (Egr-1) were increased in the nicotine groups. In human BeWo cells, nicotine decreased 11Œ≤-HSD2 expression, increased nAChRŒ±9 expression, and activated ERK1/2/Elk-1/Egr-1 signaling in the concentration (0.1-10‚ÄØŒºM)-dependent manner. Antagonism of nAChRs, inhibition of ERK1/2 and Egr-1 knockdown by siRNA were able to block/abrogate the effects of nicotine on histone modification and expression of 11Œ≤-HSD2. Taken together, nicotine can impair placental structure and function, and induce fetal developmental toxicity. The underlying mechanism involves histone modifications and down-regulation of 11Œ≤-HSD2 through nAChRs/ERK1/2/Elk-1/Egr-1 signaling, which increases active glucocorticoids levels in the placenta and fetus, and eventually inhibits the fetal development.","EGR1 protein, human,Early Growth Response Protein 1,Receptors, Nicotinic,nicotinic receptor alpha4beta2,Nicotine,11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 2","Metabolic syndrome,Occupational exposure,Risk factors,Submarine","Adolescent,Adult,Age Factors,Blood Pressure,Cross-Sectional Studies,Exercise,Humans,Life Style,Male,Metabolic Syndrome,Middle Aged,Military Personnel,Prevalence,Republic of Korea,Retrospective Studies,Risk,Young Adult"

It usually associates with metabolic disorders (MDs), which aggravates the risk of infertility, cardiometabolic events and associated comorbidities in women with PCOS. Adiponectin, a circulating protein produced by adipocytes, which has been suggested to inversely correlate with MDs. Spironolactone, a non-selective mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist, has been in wide clinical use for several decades. Herein, we investigated the effects of low dose spironolactone (LDS) and the role of adiponectin in endocrine-metabolic disturbances in experimentally-induced PCOS rats. Eighteen female Wistar rats (160-180¬†g) were randomly allotted into 3 groups and treated with vehicle (p.o.), letrozole (LET; 1¬†mg/kg) and LET + LDS (0.25¬†mg/kg), once daily for 21¬†days, respectively. The results showed that LET-treated animals had features of PCOS, characterized by elevated plasma testosterone and prolactin, increased body weight gain and ovarian weight as well as disrupted ovarian cytoarchitecture and degenerated follicles. Additionally, elevated fasting blood glucose, 1¬†h-postload glucose and plasma insulin, impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, reduced insulin sensitivity, increased plasma and ovarian lipid profile, plasma lipid peroxidation, TNF-Œ±, IL-6 and decreased plasma glutathione peroxidase and glutathione content were observed. These alterations were associated with decreased circulating adiponectin and were reversed when treated with LDS. The present results suggest that LDS ameliorates endocrine-metabolic disturbances and inflammation-related comorbidities associated with LET-induced PCOS by modulating circulating androgen-adiponectin status.","Adiponectin,Adipoq protein, rat,Biomarkers,Inflammation Mediators,Lipids,Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists,Spironolactone,Testosterone,Letrozole,Prolactin",,"Adolescent,Adult,Age of Onset,Aged,Female,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,Multiple Sclerosis,Puberty,Recurrence,Seasons,Sex Distribution"

It remains unclear whether pubertal exposure to low doses of BBP, PFOA, and ZAL has an impact on breast development and tumorigenesis. We exposed female Sprague Dawley rats to BBP, PFOA, or ZAL through gavage for 21 days, starting on day 21, and analyzed their endocrine organs, serum hormones, mammary glands, and transcriptomic profiles of the mammary glands at days 50 and 100. We also conducted a tumorigenesis study for rats treated with PFOA and ZAL using a 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) model. Our results demonstrated that pubertal exposure to BBP, PFOA, and ZAL affected endocrine organs and serum hormones, and induced phenotypic and transcriptomic changes. The exposure to PFOA + ZAL induced the most phenotypic and transcriptomic changes in the mammary gland. PFOA + ZAL downregulated the expression of genes related to development at day 50, whereas it upregulated genes associated with tumorigenesis at day 100. PFOA + ZAL exposure also decreased rat mammary tumor latency, reduced the overall survival of rats after DMBA challenge, and affected the histopathology of mammary tumors. Therefore, our study suggests that exposure to low doses of EDCs during the pubertal period could induce changes in the endocrine system and mammary gland development in rats. The inhibition of mammary gland development by PFOA + ZAL might increase the risk of developing mammary tumors through activation of signaling pathways associated with tumorigenesis.","Caprylates,Endocrine Disruptors,Fluorocarbons,Hormones,Phthalic Acids,9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene,Zeranol,perfluorooctanoic acid,butylbenzyl phthalate",,"Adolescent,Adult,Amino Acid Sequence,Base Sequence,Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors,DNA,DNA Mutational Analysis,DNA-Binding Proteins,Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2,Female,Gene Expression Regulation,Heterozygote,Humans,Insulin,Male,Middle Aged,Molecular Sequence Data,Mutation,Nuclear Proteins,Pedigree,Polymorphism, Genetic,Response Elements,Sequence Deletion,Trans-Activators,Tumor Cells, Cultured"

The primary insecticidal mode of action of OP insecticides relies on (irreversible) binding to acetylcholine esterase (AChE), with -oxon metabolites having a much higher potency for AChE inhibition than the parent compounds. However, OP insecticides can also have non-AChE-mediated effects, including changes in gene expression, neuroendocrine effects, disruption of neurite outgrowth and disturbance of the intracellular calcium (Ca) homeostasis. Since Ca is involved in neurotransmission and neuronal development, our research aimed to assess the effects of two widely used OP insecticides, chlorpyrifos (CPF) and diazinon (DZ) and their respective -oxon metabolites, on intracellular Ca homeostasis in human SH-SY5Y cells and rat primary cortical cultures. Furthermore, we assessed the acute and chronic effects of exposure to these compounds on neuronal network maturation and function in rat primary cortical cultures using microelectrode array (MEA) recordings. While inhibition of AChE appears to be the primary mode of action of oxon-metabolites, our data indicate that both parent OP insecticides (CPF and DZ) inhibit depolarization-evoked Ca influx and neuronal activity at concentrations far below their sensitivity for AChE inhibition, indicating that inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels is a common mode of action of OP insecticides. Notably, parent compounds were more potent than their oxon metabolites, with exposure to diazinon-oxon (DZO) having no effect on both neuronal activity and Ca influx. Human SH-SY5Y cells were more sensitive to OP-induced inhibition of depolarization-evoked Ca influx than rat cortical cells. Acute exposure to OP insecticides had more potent effects on neuronal activity than on Ca influx, suggesting that neuronal activity parameters are especially sensitive to OP exposure. Interestingly, the effects of DZ and chlorpyrifos-oxon (CPO) on neuronal activity lessened after 48\xa0h of exposure, while the potency of CPF did not differ over time. This suggests that neurotoxicity after exposure to different OPs has different effects over time and occurs at levels that are close to human exposure levels. In line with these results, chronic exposure to CPF during 10 days impaired neuronal network development, illustrating the need to investigate possible links between early-life OP exposure and neurodevelopmental disorders in children and highlighting the importance of non-AChE mediated mechanisms of neurotoxicity after OP exposure.'}",,,"Adolescent,Adult,Analysis of Variance,Area Under Curve,Clonidine,Disruptive, Impulse Control, and Conduct Disorders,Double-Blind Method,Gambling,Human Growth Hormone,Humans,Neurosecretory Systems,Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha-2"

Conversely, the endocrine disruptor bisphenol-A (BPA), which exerts multiple effects in this cell type via the same estrogen receptors, increased basal apoptosis. The molecular-initiated events that trigger these opposite actions have yet to be identified. We demonstrated that combined genetic downregulation and pharmacological blockade of each estrogen receptor increased apoptosis to a different extent. The increase in apoptosis induced by BPA was diminished by the pharmacological blockade or the genetic silencing of GPER, and it was partially reproduced by the GPER agonist G1. BPA and G1-induced apoptosis were abolished upon pharmacological inhibition, silencing of ERŒ± and ERŒ≤, or in dispersed islet cells from ERŒ≤ knockout (BERKO) mice. However, the ERŒ± and ERŒ≤ agonists PPT and DPN, respectively, had no effect on beta cell viability. To exert their biological actions, ERŒ± and ERŒ≤ form homodimers and heterodimers. Molecular dynamics simulations together with proximity ligand assays and coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that the interaction of BPA with ERŒ± and ERŒ≤ as well as GPER activation by G1 decreased ERŒ±Œ≤ heterodimers. We propose that ERŒ±Œ≤ heterodimers play an antiapoptotic role in beta cells and that BPA- and G1-induced decreases in ERŒ±Œ≤ heterodimers lead to beta cell apoptosis. Unveiling how different estrogenic chemicals affect the crosstalk among estrogen receptors should help to identify diabetogenic endocrine disruptors.","Endocrine Disruptors,Estrogen Receptor alpha,Estrogen Receptor beta,Estrogens,Receptors, Estrogen,Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled,Estradiol,GTP-Binding Proteins","antinuclear antibodies,benzophenone-3,cross-sectional studies (MeSH),oxybenzone,phenols,sunscreen,xenobiotics","Adolescent,Adult,Antibodies, Antinuclear,Benzhydryl Compounds,Benzophenones,Child,Cross-Sectional Studies,Female,Humans,Leukocyte Disorders,Male,Nutrition Surveys,Parabens,Phenols,Prospective Studies,Sunscreening Agents,Triclosan,Xenobiotics,Young Adult"

Several studies propose a correlation between TBBPA exposure and adverse health outcomes, however, at vascular level TBBPA effects are still poorly understood. Thus, considering that the vascular tonus is regulated by vasoactive substances (serotonin and histamine) which are involved in some pathological processes, this work aimed to analyse the direct effects and the 24\xa0h exposure of TBBPA on the human umbilical artery (HUA) and to investigate its signalling pathway. Using organ bath technique, endothelium-denuded HUA rings were contracted with serotonin (5-HT, 1\xa0ŒºM), histamine (His, 10\xa0ŒºM) and potassium chloride (KCl, 60\xa0mM), and the exposure (0-24\xa0h) of different concentrations of TBBPA (1, 10 and 50\xa0ŒºM) were evaluated. Besides, the vascular mode of action of TBBPA was studied through the analysis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate and calcium channels activity, pathways involved in relaxation and contraction of HUA, respectively. Our results demonstrated that the direct effects of TBBPA induce a vasorelaxation of HUA. The maximum relaxant effect was observed at 100\xa0ŒºM of TBBPA with 63.74%, 64.24% and 30.05%, for 5-HT-, His- or KCl-contracted arteries respectively. The 24\xa0h TBBPA exposure altered the vasorelaxant response pattern of sodium nitroprusside and nifedipine. This effect is due to the involvement of TBBPA with the NO/sGC/cGMP/PKG pathway and the interference in calcium influx. Furthermore, using the real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, TBBPA clearly modulates L-type calcium and large-conductance Ca 1.1 Œ±- and Œ≤ -subunit channels, and soluble guanylyl cyclase and protein Kinase G.

Epidemiological studies consistently indicate a correlation between leiomyoma development and exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemical phthalates, especially di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP); however, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, among the most commonly encountered phthalate metabolites, we found the strongest association between the urine levels of mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), the principal DEHP metabolite, and the risk of uterine leiomyoma diagnosis ( = 712 patients). The treatment of primary leiomyoma and smooth muscle cells ( = 29) with various mixtures of phthalate metabolites, at concentrations equivalent to those detected in urine samples, significantly increased cell viability and decreased apoptosis. MEHHP had the strongest effects on both cell viability and apoptosis. MEHHP increased cellular tryptophan and kynurenine levels strikingly and induced the expression of the tryptophan transporters SLC7A5 and SLC7A8, as well as, tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO2), the key enzyme catalyzing the conversion of tryptophan to kynurenine that is the endogenous ligand of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). MEHHP stimulated nuclear localization of AHR and up-regulated the expression of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1, two prototype targets of AHR. siRNA knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of SLC7A5/SLC7A8, TDO2, or AHR abolished MEHHP-mediated effects on leiomyoma cell survival. These findings indicate that MEHHP promotes leiomyoma cell survival by activating the tryptophan-kynurenine-AHR pathway.

The most predominant congener of PBDEs in humans and other organisms is 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47); however, the molecular mechanisms underlying its cytotoxicity remain largely unknown. Here, we evaluated the toxic effect and underlying mechanism of nuclear receptors (NRs) induced by BDE-47 in SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cells. The CCK-8 cell viability assay showed that the proliferation of human SK-N-SH cells exposed to BDE-47 was significantly inhibited in time- and dose-dependent manners, and flow cytometry showed that cell cycle was arrested at the S phase after BDE-47 exposure. Moreover, compared with the control group, the expression of retinoic acid receptor alpha (RXRŒ±), pregnane X receptor (PXR), thyroid hormone receptors (TRs), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) at the mRNA and protein levels was significantly increased, as determined by quantitative PCR and western blot analysis, demonstrating that BDE-47 activated the NRs in vitro. Moreover, BDE-47 could bind to all four NRs in the affinity order of PPARŒ≥ > PXR > TRŒ≤ > RXRŒ± under molecular dynamics. Because RXR is the promiscuous dimerization partner for a large number of NRs, ZDock was used to calculate its interaction with other three NRs. Taking the number of hydrogen bonds and ZDock scores into account, the rank of docking ability between RXRŒ± and the NRs was PXR > TRŒ≤ > PPARŒ≥. Further analysis of the interaction between BDE-47 and dimerized-NRs, the affinity order was RXRŒ± > TRŒ≤ > PXR > PPARŒ≥ via Glide. The results of this study demonstrated that BDE-47 interfered the cross-talk among NRs, especially the promiscuous RXRŒ±, which might be critical for the harmonized re-adjustment of cytotoxicity and biological regulation.

However, insufficient data on their toxicity have been reported to explain any mechanism of action, which could justify such an association. Meanwhile, short-chain PFASs designed to substitute PFOA and PFOS, have already raised increasing concerns for their biosafety. Here, we evaluated whether common PFASs affected pancreatic and endocrine cell development using a human pluripotent stem cell pancreatic induction model and human pancreatic progenitor cell (hPP) endocrine induction model. The short-chain PFASs, pentafluorobenzoic acid, perfluorohexanoic acid, perfluorobutanesulfonic acid, and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid, homologous to PFOA or PFOS, did not significantly disrupt hPP generation, unlike PFOA and PFOS, based on pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1) expression. However, SRY box 9 (SOX9) expression was suppressed in PDX1+ hPPs. All six PFASs did not disrupt SOX9 expression or hPP proliferation. However, endocrine differentiation of hPPs was affected, as indicated by neurogenin-3 (NGN3) downregulation, owing to abnormal increases in SOX9 and hairy and enhancer of split-1 (HES1) expressions. Thus, hyperactivation of NOTCH signaling was repressed after hPPs committed to the endocrine lineage. In conclusion, our study demonstrates how powerful human pluripotent stem cell-based pancreatic differentiation models can be in developmental toxicity evaluations, compared to traditional toxicity assays, mostly based on live animals. Moreover, our findings suggest that PFASs may alter pancreatic development after the pancreatic domain emerges from the gut tube, and provide insights into their toxicity mechanisms.","Alkanesulfonic Acids,Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors,Caproates,Caprylates,Fluorocarbons,Repressor Proteins,Sulfonic Acids,perfluorobutanesulfonic acid,HES5 protein, human,perfluorooctanoic acid,perfluorooctane sulfonic acid,perfluorohexanoic acid","Menarche,Menopause,Neuroendocrine,Reproduction,Type 2 diabetes mellitus","Adolescent,Adult,Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2,Female,Humans,Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System,Infertility, Female,Menarche,Menopause,Menstruation Disturbances,Ovary,Young Adult"

PBDEs may act as risk factors for autism spectrum disorders (ASD), characterized by abnormal psychosocial functioning, although direct evidence is currently lacking. Using a translational exposure model, we tested the hypothesis that maternal transfer of a commercial mixture of PBDEs, DE-71, produces ASD-relevant behavioral and neurochemical deficits in female offspring. C57Bl6/N mouse dams (F0) were exposed to DE-71 via oral administration of 0 (VEH/CON), 0.1 (L-DE-71) or 0.4 (H-DE-71) mg/kg bw/d from 3 wk prior to gestation through end of lactation. Mass spectrometry analysis indicated in utero and lactational transfer of PBDEs (in ppb) to F1 female offspring brain tissue at postnatal day (PND) 15 which was reduced by PND 110. Neurobehavioral testing of social novelty preference (SNP) and social recognition memory (SRM) revealed that adult L-DE-71 F1 offspring display deficient short- and long-term SRM, in the absence of reduced sociability, and increased repetitive behavior. These effects were concomitant with reduced olfactory discrimination of social odors. Additionally, L-DE-71 exposure also altered short-term novel object recognition memory but not anxiety or depressive-like behavior. Moreover, F1 L-DE-71 displayed downregulated mRNA transcripts for oxytocin (Oxt) in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and supraoptic nucleus, and vasopressin (Avp) in the BNST and upregulated Avp1ar in BNST, and Oxtr in the paraventricular nucleus.

Because of evidence for transgenerational effects of EDCs on the neuroendocrine control of reproductive physiology, we tested the hypothesis that prenatal PCB exposure leads to unique hypothalamic gene-expression profiles in three generations. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were treated on gestational days 16 and 18 with the PCB mixture Aroclor 1221 (A1221), vehicle (3% DMSO in sesame oil), or estradiol benzoate (EB, 50¬†Œºg/kg), the latter a positive control for estrogenic effects of A1221. Maternal- and paternal-lineage F2 and F3 generations were bred using untreated partners. The anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) and arcuate nucleus (ARC), involved in the hypothalamic control of reproduction, were dissected from F1 to F3 females and males, RNA extracted, and gene expression measured in a qPCR array. We detected unique gene-expression profiles in each generation, which were sex- and lineage-specific. In the AVPV, treatment significantly changed 10, 25, and 11 transcripts in F1, F2, and F3 generations, whereas 10, 1, and 12 transcripts were changed in these generations in the ARC. In the F1 AVPV and ARC, most affected transcripts were decreased by A1221. In the F2 AVPV, most effects of A1221 were observed in females of the maternal lineage, whereas only Pomc expression changed in the F2 ARC (by EB). The F3 AVPV and ARC were mainly affected by EB. It is notable that results in one generation do not predict results in another, and that lineage was a major determinant in results. Thus, transient prenatal exposure of F1 rats to A1221 or EB can alter hypothalamic gene expression across three generations in a sex- and lineage-dependent manner, leading to the conclusion that the legacy of PCBs continues for generations.","Aroclors,Endocrine Disruptors,aroclor 1221","Bisphenol A,age,children exposure,endocrine disruptor,geographical areas,human biomonitoring","Adolescent,Benzhydryl Compounds,Biological Monitoring,Body Weight,Child,Humans,Phenols"

Both plasticizers altered the adipocytes of the mammary gland fat pad of adult progeny, as demonstrated by a decrease in their size, folding of their membrane, and modulations of the lipid profiles. DEHP treatments decreased the expression of RxrŒ± and Scd1 at the low and high dose, respectively, but did not affect any of the other genes studied. DINCH modulation of lipid metabolism could be observed at puberty by a decreased expression of genes implicated in triglyceride synthesis, lipid transport, and lipolysis, but by an increased expression of genes of the Œ≤-oxidation pathway and of genes involved in lipid storage and fatty acid synthesis at adulthood, compared with control and DEHP-treated rats. A strong upregulation of different inflammatory markers was observed following DINCH exposure only. Together, our results indicate that a gestational and lactational exposure to DINCH has earlier and more significant effects on lipid homeostasis, adipogenesis, and the inflammatory state of the adult mammary gland than DEHP exposure. The long-term consequence of these effects on mammary gland health remained to be determined.","Cyclohexanes,Dicarboxylic Acids,Esters,Fatty Acids,Hormones,Lipids,Phthalic Acids,Plasticizers,Triglycerides,Cyclohexane,phthalic acid,Diethylhexyl Phthalate","Bisphenol A(BPA),Cell-cell communication network,Microenvironment,Reproductive toxicology,Secretory proteins,Single-cell transcriptome","Adolescent,Benzhydryl Compounds,Cell Communication,Child,Endocrine Disruptors,Humans,Male,Phenols,Puberty,Reproduction,Sertoli Cells,Single-Cell Analysis,Spermatogenesis,Testis,Transcriptome"

We previously demonstrated that exposure to the EDC organotin (OT), which is present in contaminated seafood, resulted in reproductive abnormalities in female rats. However, few studies have explored the effect of OT accumulation in seafood on pregnancy outcomes. This led us to consider the potential effects of the OT present in seafood on fertility, pregnancy, the placenta, and the offspring. In this investigation, we assessed whether exposure to the OT in contaminated seafood resulted in abnormal fertility and pregnancy features and offspring complications. OT in contaminated seafood (LNI) was administered to female rats, and their fertility, pregnancy outcomes, and fetal liver morphology were assessed. LNI caused abnormal fertility, a reduction in the total number of pups, and an increase in serum testosterone levels compared to controls. Furthermore, LNI exposure caused irregular uterine morphology with inflammation and fibrosis and led to a reduction in embryonic implantation. In pregnant rats, LNI caused abnormal lipid profiles and livers with steatosis features. LNI exposure also causes placental morpho-physiology disruption, a high presence of glycogen and inflammatory cells, and irregular lipid profiles. In addition, LNI exposure caused an increase in large amounts of carbohydrate and lipid delivery to the fetus via an increase in placental nutrient sensor protein expressions (GLUT1, IRŒ≤/mTOR and Akt). In both genders of offspring, LNI exposure led to an increase in body weights, liver megakaryocytes, lipid accumulation, and oxidative stress (OS) levels. Collectively, these data suggest that OT exposure from contaminated seafood in female rats leads to reduced fertility, uterine implantation failure, pregnancy and placental metabolic outcome irregularities, offspring adiposity, liver steatosis, and an increase in OS. Furthermore, some of the effects of OT may be the result of obesogenic and multigenerational effects of OT in adult female rats.",Organotin Compounds,"Endocrine disruptor,Exposure,Personal care products,Preservatives,p-hydroxybenzoic acid","Adolescent,Biological Monitoring,Child,Child, Preschool,Environmental Exposure,Environmental Monitoring,Environmental Pollutants,Germany,Humans,Parabens"

However, the direct evidence for BPA exposure affecting neural circuits has been limited. In this study, a virus tracing assay has been established to explore the brain's neural circuits. Thy1-Cre mice were used to investigate the effects of BPA on the neural projection of glutamatergic pyramidal neurons in hippocampal CA1 based on Thy1 promoter. These transgenic mice were orally exposed to BPA (0, 0.5\xa0mg/kg/day) from postnatal day (PND) 0 to PND60 and then subjected to behavioral tests. Morris water maze(MWM)and Barnes maze's showed that the spatial memory was seriously impaired in BPA exposed Thy1-Cre mice. Virus tracing assay indicated that CA1 pyramidal neurons mainly received neural inputs from hippocampal CA3, entorhinal cortex (EC), and medial septum (MS). The analysis showed that BPA reduced the number of RV neurons in CA3 and EC but not MS. The immunohistochemistry experiment displayed that BPA decreased the percentage of CaMKII cells in CA3 and EC. The results demonstrated that the synaptic connection of upstream glutamatergic neurons and CA1 pyramidal cells was weakened by BPA exposure. These point to potentially detrimental effects of BPA exposure on the excitatory neural circuit of CA3-CA1 and EC-CA1 in memory formation. Thus, our findings revealed that the decrease in excitatory neural circuits of CA3-CA1 and EC-CA1 contribute to the BPA-induced spatial memory deficits in Thy1-Cre mice.""}","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Phenols,bisphenol A",,"Adolescent,Body Mass Index,Carbanilides,Cardiovascular Diseases,Child,Chlorophenols,Female,Humans,Iran,Male,Obesity,Risk Factors,Triglycerides"

DEHP can be found in medical equipment and devices, food containers, building materials, and children's toys. Although DEHP exposure occurs most commonly by ingesting contaminated foods in the majority of the population, its effects on the gastrointestinal tract have not been well studied. Therefore, we analyzed the effects of subchronic exposure to DEHP on the ileum and colon morphology, gene expression, and immune microenvironment. Adult C57BL/6 female mice were orally dosed with corn oil (control, n¬†=¬†7) or DEHP (0.02, 0.2, or 30¬†mg/kg, n¬†=¬†7/treatment dose) for 30-34 days. Mice were euthanized during diestrus, and colon and ileum tissues were collected for RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry. Subchronic DEHP exposure in the ileum altered the expression of several immune-mediating factors (Muc1, Lyz1, Cldn1) and cell viability factors (Bcl2 and Aifm1). Similarly, DEHP exposure in the colon impacted the gene expression of factors involved in mediating immune responses (Muc3a, Zo2, Ocln, Il6, and Il17a); and also altered the expression of cell viability factors (Ki67, Bcl2, Cdk4, and Aifm1) as well as a specialized epithelial cell marker (Vil1). Immunohistochemical analysis of the ileum showed DEHP increased expression of VIL1, CLDN1, and TNF and decreased number of T-cells in the villi. Histological analysis of the colon showed DEHP altered morphology and reduced cell proliferation. Moreover, in the colon, DEHP increased the expression of MUC2, MUC1, VIL1, CLDN1, and TNF. DEHP also increased the number of T-cells and Type 2 immune cells in the colon. These data suggest that subchronic DEHP exposure differentially affects the ileum and colon and alters colonic morphology and the intestinal immune microenvironment. These results have important implications for understanding the effects of DEHP on the gastrointestinal system.","phthalic acid,Diethylhexyl Phthalate,Ki-67 Antigen,Corn Oil,Interleukin-6,Plastics,Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2","Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs),Heavy metal,Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs),Phthalate,Resting-state brain fMRI","Adolescent,Brain,Brain Mapping,Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Exposure,Female,Humans,Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Male,Pregnancy,Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects"

However, their increasing use is also contaminating the environment, which is a potential cause of concern for human health. Thyroid hormone transport and signaling are potential targets for endocrine-disrupting activity of BPA analogs. Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) is the major carrier protein for thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) in blood. Thyroid hormones exert their action through thyroid hormone receptors (TRŒ± and TRŒ≤). This report presents the thyroid-disrupting potential of indicated nine BPA analogs from structure-based studies with TBG and TRŒ±. Each BPA analog formed important polar and hydrophobic interactions with a number of residues of TBG and TRŒ±. Majority of TBG residues (77-100%) and TRŒ± residues (70-91%) interacting with BPA analogs were common with those of native ligands T4 and T3, respectively. Majority of BPA analogs interacted with TBG forming a salt bridge interaction at Lys-270. The hydrogen-bonding interaction of T3 with TRŒ± at His-381 was also shared by majority of analogs. The binding energy for BPP, BPB, BPZ, BPAP, and TMBPA with both proteins was closer to binding energy of respective native ligands. The similarity in structural binding characteristics suggested potential disrupting activity of thyroid hormone signaling and transport.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Phenols,Receptors, Thyroid Hormone,Thyroxine-Binding Globulin,bisphenol A","Hypocalcemia,Hypoparathyroidism,Pediatric population,Total thyroidectomy","Adolescent,Child,Child, Preschool,Female,Humans,Hypocalcemia,Hypoparathyroidism,Incidence,Infant,Infant, Newborn,Male,Postoperative Complications,Retrospective Studies,Risk Factors,Thyroid Diseases,Thyroidectomy,Treatment Outcome"

The results indicated that BDE-47 up to 80¬†ŒºM under a 6¬†h/18¬†h (exposure/recovery, covering 2¬†cell cycles) regime did not induce micronuclei in V79-Mz and V79-derived cell lines expressing human CYP1A1 or 1A2, while it was moderately positive in human CYP2B6-, 2E1-and 3A4-expressing cell lines (V79-hCYP2B6, V79-hCYP2E1-hSULT1A1 and V79-hCYP3A4-hOR, respectively).

Cineole (CIN) has that effect of regulating immune function and resist oxidation. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are one of the ways to resist pathogen invasion. In order to explore the effects of BPA and CIN on the release of chicken NETs and the antagonistic effect of CIN, take chicken peripheral blood neutrophils as object of study, grouping as NC, CIN, BPA¬†+¬†CIN and BPA. SEM, flow cytometry, RT-PCR, Western-blot and other methods were used to detect related indicators. The results showed that BPA inhibited the activities of GPX, SOD and CAT, increased the contents of MDA and NO, increased the activity of iNOS. BPA exposure inhibited the expression of myeloperoxidase (MPO), neutrophil elastase (NE) and histone, and inhibited the release of NETs. BPA activated downstream apoptosis and necroptosis through the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK) pathway, which increased the expression of cytochrome C (CytC), bcl-2 associated K protein gene (bak), cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 3 (caspase-3), cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 9 (caspase-9), receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK3) and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL), decreased the expression of B-cell lymphoma-2 (bcl-2). However, the co-exposure of CIN and BPA partially recovered the release of NETs, alleviated BPA-induced oxidative stress, and inhibited the activation of p38-MAPK pathway, necroptosis, and mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. These results indicated that CIN modulated p38 pathway alleviated BPA-induced neutrophil necroptosis and apoptosis, and increased NETs formation.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Phenols,Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2,Aspartic Acid,p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases,bisphenol A,Eucalyptol","Biomarkers,Breast development,Maternal-child health,Phthalates,Pregnancy exposures,Puberty","Adolescent,Child,Cities,Female,Humans,Male,Mexico,Phenols,Phthalic Acids,Sexual Maturation"

The present study was conducted to investigate the effect of chronic exposure to BPA on the adult female neuroendocrine system. Herein, we found that expose of adult female mice to BPA (50‚ÄâŒºg/kg) by oral gavage for 60 days (BPA mice) prolonged diestrus and decreased serum 17Œ≤-estradiol (E2) concentration by reducing the number of antral follicles and corpora luteum. In comparison with controls, the levels of serum luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), hypothalamic gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) and the expression of kisspeptin in anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) decreased in BPA mice, which could be reversed by injecting kisspeptin-10 (i.c.v.). Treatment with BPA or estrogen receptor Œ± (ERŒ±) antagonist MPP, but not ERŒ≤ antagonist PHTPP inhibited E2-induced AVPV-kisspeptin expression in ovariectomized mice. Use of ERŒ± agonist PPT rather than ERŒ≤ agonist DPN enhanced AVPV-kisspepetin expression, which decreased after treatment with BPA. The amplitude of the proestrus LH surge decreased in mice exposed to BPA, but was recovered by administering kisspeptin-10. The present study provides in vivo evidence that chronic exposure to a low dose of BPA suppressed ERŒ±-induced activation of AVPV-kisspeptin neurons, leading to prolonged diestrus and reduced ovulation in adult female mice.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Esr1 protein, mouse,Estrogen Receptor alpha,Kisspeptins,Phenols,bisphenol A","birth outcomes,endocrine disruptors,phthalate,pregnancy outcomes,prenatal exposure","Adolescent,Child,Female,Humans,Infant,Infant, Newborn,Male,Mothers,Phthalic Acids,Pregnancy,Premature Birth,Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects"

One possible mechanism is through disruption of placental corticotropin releasing hormone (pCRH), a key hormone implicated in parturition. As an extension of recent research identifying pCRH as a potential target of endocrine disruption, we examined maternal PAH exposure in relation to pCRH in a large, diverse sample. Participants, drawn from the CANDLE cohort, part of the ECHO-PATHWAYS Consortium, completed study visits at 16-29 weeks (V1) and 22-39 weeks (V2) gestation (n=812). Seven urinary mono-hydroxylated PAH metabolites (OH-PAHs) were measured at V1 and serum pCRH at V1 and V2. Associations between individual log-transformed OH-PAHs (as well as two summed PAH measures) and log(pCRH) concentrations across visits were estimated using mixed effects models. Minimally-adjusted models included gestational age and urinary specific gravity, while fully-adjusted models also included sociodemographic characteristics. We additionally evaluated effect modification by pregnancy complications, fetal sex, and maternal childhood trauma history. We observed associations between 2-OH-Phenanthrene (2-OH-PHEN) and rate of pCRH change that persisted in fully adjusted models (Œ≤=0.0009, 0.00006, 0.0017), however, positive associations with other metabolites (most notably 3-OH-Phenanthrene and 1-Hydroxypyrene) were attenuated after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics. Associations tended to be stronger at V1 compared to V2 and we observed no evidence of effect modification by pregnancy complications, fetal sex, or maternal childhood trauma history. In conclusion, we observed modest evidence of association between OH-PAHs, most notably 2-OH-PHEN, and pCRH in this sample. Additional research using serial measures of PAH exposure is warranted, as is investigation of alternative mechanisms that may link PAHs and timing of birth, such as inflammatory, epigenetic, or oxidative stress pathways.","Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone,Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons,Vitamins,Phenanthrenes","Biomonitoring,Endocrine-disrupting,Exposure,Personal care products,Urinary parabens","Adolescent,Cosmetics,Endocrine Disruptors,Feeding Behavior,Food,Humans,Iran,Male,Parabens,Sunscreening Agents"

To understand the underlying mechanisms, we performed histological, endocrinological, and biochemical analyses and assessed the expression of genes involved in spermatogenesis and sperm function according to OECD test guideline 407. Following 28 days of administration of the lowest observed adverse effect level dose of DBP to mice, no significant changes in body weight, testis and epididymis weights and histology, serum testosterone level, or testicular daily sperm production were found. Nonetheless, the motility of the epididymal sperm of the DBP group was significantly decreased together with an increase in the incidence of bent tails and abnormal heads. In the testes of the DBP group, lipid peroxidation (LPO) level was significantly increased and testicular Bcl-2 mRNA level was significantly decreased together with an increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 mRNA ratio. In the testes of the DBP group, levels of Prnd mRNA and protein and Pou4f1 mRNA, an activator of the Prnd promotor, were significantly decreased. Of note, prion-like protein doppel (PRND) was significantly decreased together with decreased PRND immunoreactivity in the head, midpiece, and tail of sperm. In the testes of the DBP group, levels of Sox9, Sgp1, and Sgp2 mRNA, which are functional Sertoli cell markers, were significantly decreased. Level of Amh mRNA, a Sertoli cell immaturity marker, was significantly increased together with that of Inha mRNA, suggesting deregulation of the brain-gonadal axis. Together, our findings suggest that DBP at present dosage may potentiate LPO generation and Sertoli cell immaturity via downregulation of Sox9 and disruption of the Pou4f1-Prnd gene network in post-meiotic germ cells without visible changes in spermatogenesis or testosterone level. This may result in structural and functional abnormalities in spermatozoa. Additionally, our findings suggest that assessment of the male reproductive toxicity of phthalate ester plasticizers based on conventional OECD test guidelines should be reconsidered.","Plasticizers,phthalic acid,Prions,Testosterone,Dibutyl Phthalate,Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2,RNA, Messenger","Disorders of sex development,Gender disorders,Gonadotropin-releasing hormone","Adolescent,Endocrine Disruptors,Gender Dysphoria,Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone,Humans,Puberty,Sexual Development,Transgender Persons"

To investigate the neurotoxic effects of BPA, BPS, and BPB as well as their underlying mechanism, IMR-32¬†cell line from male and SK-N-SH cell line from female were exposed respectively to BPA, BPS and BPB with concentrations of 1¬†nM, 10¬†nM, 100¬†nM, 1¬†ŒºM, 10¬†ŒºM, and 100¬†ŒºM for 24¬†h. Additionally, 24¬†h exposure of BPA combining epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) (4¬†ŒºM and 8¬†ŒºM for IMR-32 and SK-N-SH respectively) were conducted. Results demonstrated that BPs exposure could promote reactive oxygen species production and increase level of malondialdehyde (MDA) while decrease levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD). Intensive study revealed that after exposure to BPA mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) dropped down and the protein expression levels of Bak-1, Bax, cytochrome c and Caspase-3 were up-regulated but Bcl-2 were down-regulated significantly. Moreover, apoptosis rate was raised and cell activity declined remarkably in the neuroblastoma cells. All the effects induced by BPA could be alleviated by the adding of EGCG, which similar alleviations could be inferred in IMR-32 and SK-N-SH cells induced by BPS and BPB. Furthermore, BPS showed lower neurotoxic effects compared to BPA and BPB. Interestingly, the neurotoxic effects of BPA on IMR-32¬†cells were significantly higher than those on SK-N-SH cells.

However, we did not know whether these effects were caused by parent organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) or metabolite DAPs, especially the non-specific metabolite diethyl phosphate (DEP), which was the metabolic end product of most widely used diethyl OPs. In this study, animal experiments (in vivo), cell experiments (in vitro), small molecule-protein binding interaction experiments and computer molecular simulations (in silico) were used to explore the disturbing effects and molecular mechanisms of DEP on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis endocrine hormones. The animal experiments showed that chronic DEP exposure significantly disturbed the serum contents of HPA axis hormones in adult male rats. The target genes of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in rat liver, including 11Œ≤-hsd1 and Pepck1 and PEPCK protein expressions, were down-regulated. Moreover, the gluconeogenic abilities of rats were impaired. However, it did not affect the expression of GR in the rat hypothalamus. These results indicated that the physiological functions of glucocorticoids and GR were damaged. Furthermore, spectroscopy experiments, cell experiments, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations also suggested that DEP can bind to nuclear receptors GR and Nur77, affecting their transcription factor functions, and the transcriptional expression levels of their downstream target genes were reduced. The biosynthesis and secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone and glucocorticoids were blocked. Therefore, DEP can inhibit the production and physiological functions of HPA axis endocrine hormones by disrupting these related proteins and antagonizing nuclear receptors. These results were considered to provide a theoretical basis for strictly controlling the residue limits of OPs and their metabolites in foods, agricultural products and the environment. They also revealed new targets for evaluating the toxicities and risks of pesticide metabolites.","Glucocorticoids,Nr4a1 protein, rat,Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1,Organophosphates,Pesticides,Receptors, Glucocorticoid,Transcription Factors,diethyl phosphate",,"Adrenal Cortex Neoplasms,Adrenocortical Carcinoma,Cell Culture Techniques,Cell Line, Tumor,Humans,Iron"

Infants are exposed to genistein (GEN) through soy-based formula, and to Mono(2-ethylhexyl) Phthalate (MEHP), metabolite of the plasticizer DEHP. Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) are formed in infancy and their integrity is essential for spermatogenesis. Thus, understanding the impact of EDCs on SSCs is critical. Prostaglandins (PGs) are inflammatory mediators synthesized via the eicosanoid pathway starting with cyclooxygenases (Coxs), that regulate physiological and pathological processes. Our goal was to study the eicosanoid pathway in SSCs and examine whether it was disrupted by GEN and MEHP, potentially contributing to their adverse effects. The mouse C18-4 cell line used as SSC model expressed high levels of Cox1 and Cox2 genes and proteins, and eicosanoid pathway genes similarly to levels measured in primary rat spermatogonia. Treatments with GEN and MEHP at 10 and 100 ŒºM decreased Cox1 gene and protein expression, whereas Cox2, phospholipase A2, prostaglandin synthases transcripts, PGE2, PGF2a and PGD2 were upregulated. Simultaneously, the transcript levels of spermatogonia progenitor markers Foxo1 and Mcam and differentiated spermatogonial markers cKit and Stra8 were increased. Foxo1 was also increased by EDCs in primary rat spermatogonia. This study shows that the eicosanoid pathway is altered during SSC differentiation and that exposure to GEN and MEHP disrupts this process, mainly driven by GEN effects on Cox2 pathway, while MEHP acts through an alternative mechanism. Thus, understanding the role of Cox enzymes in SSCs and how GEN and MEHP exposures alter their differentiation warrants further studies.","Eicosanoids,Endocrine Disruptors,Diethylhexyl Phthalate,Genistein,Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases,mono-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate","Adrenal cortex,Aldosterone,Corticosterone,Development,Rat,Triphenyltin","Adrenal Cortex,Adrenocorticotropic Hormone,Aldosterone,Animals,Corticosterone,Environmental Pollutants,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Organotin Compounds,RNA-Seq,Rats,Sexual Maturation"

DPTE displayed androgen antagonist activity reminiscent of castration. The transcription profile of the prostate was altered by castration and exposure to testosterone and to TBECHŒ≥Œ¥ reversed several of these changes. Testosterone and TBECHŒ≥Œ¥ also regulated the expression of several androgen responsive genes implicated in prostate growth and cancer.

Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is the most abundant phthalate and it impairs fertility by acting as an endocrine disruptor. The aim of the present study was to analyze the effects of in vitro acute exposure to DEHP on oocyte maturation, energy and oxidative status in the horse, a large animal model. Cumulus cell (CC) apoptosis and oxidative status were also investigated. Cumulus-oocyte complexes from the ovaries of slaughtered mares were cultured in vitro in presence of 0.12, 12 and 1200 M DEHP. After in vitro maturation (IVM), CCs were removed and evaluated for apoptosis (cytological assessment and TUNEL) and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Oocytes were evaluated for nuclear chromatin configuration. Matured (Metaphase II stage; MII) oocytes were further evaluated for cytoplasmic energy and oxidative parameters. DEHP significantly inhibited oocyte maturation when added at low doses (0.12 M; P<0.05). This effect was related to increased CC apoptosis (P<0.001) and reduced ROS levels (P<0.0001). At higher doses (12 and 1200 M), DEHP induced apoptosis (P<0.0001) and ROS increase (P<0.0001) in CCs without affecting oocyte maturation. In DEHP-exposed MII oocytes, mitochondrial distribution patterns, apparent energy status (MitoTracker fluorescence intensity), intracellular ROS localization and levels, mt/ROS colocalization and total SOD activity did not vary, whereas increased ATP content (P<0.05), possibly of glycolytic origin, was found. Co-treatment with N-Acetyl-Cysteine reversed apoptosis and efficiently scavenged excessive ROS in DEHP-treated CCs without enhancing oocyte maturation. In conclusion, acute in vitro exposure to DEHP inhibits equine oocyte maturation without altering ooplasmic energy and oxidative stress parameters in matured oocytes which retain the potential to be fertilized and develop into embryos even though further studies are necessary to confirm this possibility.","Free Radical Scavengers,Plasticizers,Reactive Oxygen Species,Diethylhexyl Phthalate,Superoxide Dismutase,Acetylcysteine",,"Adrenocorticotropic Hormone,Adult,Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic,Female,Fibromyalgia,Humans,Hydrocortisone,Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System,Male,Pituitary-Adrenal System,Prolactin"

And HE-staining showed that for the control group, many chronic inflammatory cell infiltration and nasal mucosal destruction were observed in the OVA‚Äâ+‚ÄâDEHP group and were more severe than the OVA group. Allergic symptom scores were obtained from sneezing, scratching, number of scratching, and nose flow. The scores of the OVA group and the OVA‚Äâ+‚ÄâDEHP group were higher than 7 points. Serum ELISA and nasal mucosal oxidative stress tests are more serious in the OVA‚Äâ+‚ÄâDEHP group.

Pregnant mice were subcutaneously injected with BPA (0, 50, 500 ng/kg and 250 ¬µg/kg BW) daily between gestational days 11-19. Female offspring were examined for mammary tumorigenesis, puberty onset, mammary morphogenesis, and signaling in ER and erbB2 pathways. In utero exposure to low dose BPA (500 ng/kg) induced mammary tumorigenesis, earlier puberty onset, increased terminal end buds, and prolonged estrus phase, which was accompanied by proliferative mammary morphogenesis. CD24/49f-based FACS analysis showed that in utero exposure to 500 ng/kg BPA induced expansion of luminal and basal/myoepithelial cell subpopulations at PND 35. Molecular analysis of mammary tissues at PND 70 showed that in utero exposure to low doses of BPA induced upregulation of ERŒ±, -ERŒ±, cyclin D1, and c-myc, concurrent activation of erbB2, EGFR, erbB-3, Erk1/2, and Akt, and upregulation of growth factors/ligands. Our results demonstrate that in utero exposure to low dose BPA promotes mammary tumorigenesis in MMTV-erbB2 mice through induction of ER-erbB2 crosstalk and mammary epithelial reprogramming, which advance our understanding of the mechanism associated with in utero exposure to BPA-induced breast cancer risk.

Neonatal male rats were injected subcutaneously from d 5 to 14 after birth with corn oil (control) and DBP (5, 10, or 20 mg/animal). Animals were killed at postnatal day (PND) 31 and PND 42, respectively, and testes, epididymis, seminal vesicles, ventral prostate, levator ani plus bulbocavernosus muscles (LABC), and Cowper's glands were weighed. In addition, the expressions of androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptors (ERs), and steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) were also examined in the testes. Total body weights gains were significantly reduced at PND 29-31, but gradually recovered on PND 42. However, DBP (20 mg/animal) significantly reduced the weights of testes and accessory sex organs (seminal vesicles, LABC, and Cowper's glands), but not of the epididymis. These adverse effects persisted through puberty at PND 42. Serum testosterone levels did not show any significant changes in the control and DBP treatment groups. Histomorphological examination showed mild diffuse Leydig-cell hyperplasia in the interstitium of severely affected tubules on PND 31. Only a few multinuclear germ cells were observed. DBP (20 mg/animal) significantly decreased the expression of AR, whereas ER expression and SF-1 expression were increased in a dose-dependent manner on PND 31 in the rat testes. On PND 42, DBP (20 mg/animal) significantly inhibited ER expression in the testes, but not AR, ER, and SF-1. These results demonstrate that neonatal exposure to DBP produces permanent changes in the endocrine system and leads to abnormal male reproductive-tract development until puberty. Thus our data suggest that DBP is likely to exert its antiandrogenic actions through disruption of AR or ER expression during the early neonatal stage.","Receptors, Androgen,Receptors, Estrogen,Steroidogenic Factor 1,steroidogenic factor 1, rat,Dibutyl Phthalate",,"Adrenocorticotropic Hormone,Animals,Brain Injuries,Humans,Neurosecretory Systems,Pituitary Gland, Anterior,Pituitary Hormones, Anterior,Prolactin,Thyrotropin"

BPA is considered to be involved in the impairment of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism but the underlying mechanisms still need to be elucidated. Present study was aimed to investigate the impact of BPA exposure on enzymatic and metabolic pathways that are responsible to regulate the carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Experimental rats were exposed to different doses of BPA (50, 500, 2500 and 5000‚ÄØŒºg/kg/day orally) dissolved in 1.5% dimethyl sulfoxide for a period of 3 months. Serum level of key metabolic enzymes (Œ±-amylase, Œ±-glucosidase, hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphatase and HMG-CoA-reductase) was measured by ELISA method. BPA-exposure suppressed the mRNA expression of gene encoding insulin resulting in poor insulin production. While hexokinase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and squalene epoxide were up-regulated upon BPA exposure that justified the increased lipid profile. Moreover, BPA exposure showed considerably decreased glucose uptake through insulin signaling via Akt/GLUT4 pathways. There was a significant (p‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ0.001) reduction in tissue level of glucose transporters. BPA significantly (p‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ0.001) decreased the serum levels of oxidative stress biomarkers (GSH, CAT, and SOD). Serum levels of leptin, TNF-Œ±, and IL-6 were rapidly increased upon exposure to BPA (p‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ0.001). It was clearly evident from this study that BPA disturbed the carbohydrate and lipid metabolism after chronic exposure. It also accelerated the inflammatory processes by increasing the oxidative stress which ultimately lead towards the insulin resistance and impaired carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Blood Glucose,Endocrine Disruptors,Glucose Transporter Type 2,Glucose Transporter Type 4,Insulin,Phenols,Slc2a2 protein, rat,Slc2a4 protein, rat,bisphenol A",,"Adrenocorticotropic Hormone,Animals,Cadmium,Cell Survival,Dose-Response Relationship, Drug,Drug Combinations,Female,Hydrocortisone,Hydroxycholesterols,In Vitro Techniques,Interrenal Gland,Male,Oncorhynchus mykiss,Water Pollutants, Chemical"

However, little is known about risks related to emerging chemicals, such as organophosphate esters (OPEs) and alternative plasticizers (APs). A case-control study was conducted to investigate whether exposures to OPEs, APs, and phthalates, were associated with uterine fibroids in women of reproductive age. For this purpose, the cases (n¬†=¬†32) and the matching controls (n¬†=¬†79) were chosen based on the results of gynecologic ultrasonography among premenopausal adult women in Korea and measured for metabolites of several OPEs, APs, and major phthalates. Logistic regression models were employed to assess the associations between chemical exposure and disease status. Factor analysis was conducted for multiple chemical exposure assessments as a secondary analysis. Among OPE metabolites, diphenyl phosphate (DPHP), 2-ethylhexyl phenyl phosphate (EHPHP), and 1-hydroxy-2-propyl bis(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BCIPHIPP) were detected in >80% of the subjects. Among APs, metabolites of di-isononyl phthalate (DINP) and di(2-propylheptyl) phthalate (DPrHpP) were detected in >75% of the urine samples. The odds ratios (ORs) of uterine fibroids were significantly higher among the women with higher exposures to tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) and tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP), di(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate (DEHTP), DPrHpP, and di-(iso-nonyl)-cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylate (DINCH).

However, the toxic effects of sodium p-perfluorous nonenoxybenzene sulfonate (OBS) on the endocrine system have not been elucidated. In this study, OBS was added to the drinking water during the pregnancy and lactation of the healthy female mice at dietary levels of 0.0 mg/L (CON), 0.5 mg/L (OBS-L), and 5.0 mg/L (OBS-H). OBS exposure during the pregnancy and lactation resulted in the presence of OBS residues in the placenta and fetus. We also analyzed physiological and biochemical parameters and gene expression levels in mice of the F0 and F1 generations after maternal OBS exposure. The total serum cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were significantly increased in female mice of the F0 generation. The androgen levels in the serum and the ovarian mRNA levels of androgen receptor (AR) also tended to increase after maternal OBS exposure in the F0 generation mice. Moreover, maternal OBS exposure altered the mRNA expression of endocrine-related genes in male mice of F1 generation. Notably, the serum TC and LDL-C levels were significantly increased in 8-weeks-old male mice of the F1 generation, and the serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were decreased in 24-week-old male mice of the F1 generation. These results indicated that maternal OBS exposure can interfere with endocrine homeostasis in the F0 and F1 generations. Therefore, exposure to OBS during pregnancy and lactation has the potential toxic effects on the dams and male offspring, which cannot be overlooked.","Androgens,Cholesterol, HDL,Cholesterol, LDL,Endocrine Disruptors,Estrogen Receptor alpha,Estrogens,RNA, Messenger,Receptors, Androgen,Cholesterol,17-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases",,"Adrenocorticotropic Hormone,Anorexia Nervosa,Body Weight,CD4 Antigens,CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes,Cell Adhesion Molecules,Dexamethasone,Humans,Hydrocortisone,L-Selectin,Leukocyte Count,Pituitary-Adrenal System,Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing"

To clarify this issue, we tested the effects of prolonged low-dose BPA exposure on different phases of adipogenesis in committed  and uncommitted  preadipocytes. Our findings show that BPA effects on the adipogenesis are mediated by epigenetic mechanisms by reducing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma () promoter methylation in preadipocytes.

Intriguingly, male and female offspring are differentially vulnerable to the effects of PPD. Antidepressants, such as fluoxetine, are commonly prescribed for treating PPD. However, fluoxetine can reach offspring via breast milk, raising serious concerns regarding the long-term consequences of infant exposure to fluoxetine. The goal of this study was to examine the long-term effects of maternal postpartum corticosterone (CORT, a model of postpartum stress/depression) and concurrent maternal postpartum fluoxetine on behavioral, endocrine, and neural measures in adult male and female offspring. Female Sprague-Dawley dams were treated daily with either CORT or oil and fluoxetine or saline from postnatal days 2-23, and offspring were weaned and left undisturbed until adulthood. Here we show that maternal postpartum fluoxetine increased anxiety-like behavior and impaired hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis negative feedback in adult male, but not female, offspring. Furthermore, maternal postpartum fluoxetine increased the density of immature neurons (doublecortin-expressing) in the hippocampus of adult male offspring but decreased the density of immature neurons in adult female offspring. Maternal postpartum CORT blunted HPA axis negative feedback in males and tended to increase density of immature neurons in males but decreased it in females. These results indicate that maternal postpartum CORT and fluoxetine can have long-lasting effects on anxiety-like behavior, HPA axis negative feedback, and adult hippocampal neurogenesis and that adult male and female offspring are differentially affected by these maternal manipulations.","Anti-Anxiety Agents,Dcx protein, rat,Doublecortin Domain Proteins,Doublecortin Protein,Microtubule-Associated Proteins,Neuropeptides,Fluoxetine,Dexamethasone,Corticosterone","Mn(III),MnO2,activated carbon,adsorption,bisphenol A degradation,manganese oxides,small-angle neutron scattering (SANS)","Adsorption,Benzhydryl Compounds,Manganese,Manganese Compounds,Oxidation-Reduction,Oxides,Phenols"

Our previous studies have primarily focused on TCDD induced impairment of ovarian follicular development in female F1 rats. It is unknown whether TCDD exposure will interfere with follicular development by altering mRNA expression of anti-M√ºllerian hormone (AMH) and AMH receptor type II (AMHR2) in the ovary. In the present study, pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were treated with TCDD (100 or 500¬†ng/kg body weight) dissolved in a corn oil vehicle by gavage from gavage from gestational days (GD) 8-14, while the control group received solely corn oil. The F1 rats were mated with unexposed males for the F2 generation, while another portion of the female offspring (F2) were mated for the F3 generation. Serum AMH levels and ovarian AMH/AMHR2 mRNA expression in the adult female offspring (F1, F2 and F3 generations) were measured. Follicle count and granulosa cell apoptosis were evaluated in the F2 and F3 generations. The results showed that in the F2 generation, TCDD exposure affected the number of primordial follicles, secondary follicles, and corpora lutea. It also increased serum AMH concentration and the apoptosis rate of granulosa cells. These results might be associated with the upregulation of AMH/AMHR2 mRNA expression in the ovary. In conclusion, TCDD exposure reduced the ovarian reserve in rats and inhibited follicular development in adult female offspring, an effect that persisted for multiple generations.

35460815,-142,Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS),Genetic,PFOS-induced thyroid hormone system disrupted rats display organ-specific changes in their transcriptomes.,"Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) is a persistent anthropogenic chemical that can affect the thyroid hormone system in humans and animals. In adults, thyroid hormones (THs) are regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis, but also by organs such as the liver and potentially the gut microbiota. PFOS and other xenobiotics can therefore disrupt the TH system at various locations and through different mechanisms. To start addressing this, we exposed adult male rats to 3¬†mg PFOS/kg/day for 7 days and analysed effects on multiple organs and pathways simultaneously by transcriptomics. This included four primary organs involved in TH regulation, namely hypothalamus, pituitary, thyroid, and liver. To investigate a potential role of the gut microbiota in thyroid hormone regulation, two additional groups of animals were dosed with the antibiotic vancomycin (8¬†mg/kg/day), either with or without PFOS. PFOS exposure decreased thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) without affecting thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), resembling a state of hypothyroxinemia. PFOS exposure resulted in 50 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the hypothalamus, 68 DEGs in the pituitary, 71 DEGs in the thyroid, and 181 DEGs in the liver. A concomitant compromised gut microbiota did not significantly change effects of PFOS exposure. Organ-specific DEGs did not align with TH regulating genes; however, genes associated with vesicle transport and neuronal signaling were affected in the hypothalamus, and phase I and phase II metabolism in the liver. This suggests that a decrease in systemic TH levels may activate the expression of factors altering trafficking, metabolism and excretion of TH. At the transcriptional level, little evidence suggests that the pituitary or thyroid gland is involved in PFOS-induced TH system disruption.","Alkanesulfonic Acids,Fluorocarbons,Thyroid Hormones,perfluorooctane sulfonic acid","Adsorption,Calcium-based,Endocrine-disrupting compounds,Metal-organic framework","Adsorption,Calcium,Endocrine Disruptors,Humans,Metal-Organic Frameworks,Water Purification"

Dams were dosed from gestational day 6 to postnatal day 21 at doses of 0 (control), 1.7 (low) or 10.2 (high) mg/kg/day, and male offspring from all doses at 3-months-old were subjected to normosmotic and hyperosmotic challenge. Male offspring where later assessed for alterations in osmoregulation (i.e. serum osmolality and systemic vasopressin release), and both vasopressin immunoreactivity (AVP-IR) and gene expression in the hypothalamic paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei. Additionally, to elucidate a possible mechanism for the effects of DE-79 on the AVPergic system, both neuronal nitric oxide synthase immunoreactivity (nNOS-IR) and mRNA expression were investigated in the same hypothalamic nuclei. The results showed that perinatal DE-79 exposure AVP-IR, mRNA expression and systemic release in adulthood under normosmotic conditions and more evidently under hyperosmotic stimulation. nNOS-IR and mRNA expression were also affected in the same nuclei. Since NO is an AVP regulator, we propose that disturbances in NO could be a mechanism underlying the AVPergic system disruption following perinatal DE-79 exposure leading to osmoregulation deficits.","Environmental Pollutants,Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers,Vasopressins,Nitric Oxide,Nitric Oxide Synthase Type I,Nos1 protein, rat","breast cancer,case‚Äìcontrol study,circadian rhythm,nightwork","Adult,Aged,Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors,Breast Neoplasms,CLOCK Proteins,Case-Control Studies,Circadian Clocks,Female,France,Gene-Environment Interaction,Humans,Middle Aged,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 1,Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide,Postmenopause,Risk,Work"

Proper thyroid functioning is especially important for women of reproductive age, as hypothyroidism affects fertility, pregnancy outcomes and the offspring. There are no studies analyzing the influence of BPs on thyroid function and volume in non-pregnant young women. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the relationship between bisphenol¬†A and its 10 analogs (BPS, BPC, BPE, BPF, BPG, BPM, BPP, BPZ, BPFL, and BPBP) on thyroid function and volume in women of reproductive age. Inclusion criteria were: female sex, age 18-40 years. Exclusion criteria were history of any thyroid disease, pharmacotherapy influencing thyroid function, pregnancy or puerperium, and diagnosis of autoimmune thyroid disease during this study. Venous blood was drawn for measurement of thyrotropin (TSH), free thyroxine, thyroid peroxidase antibodies, thyroglobulin antibodies, BPs. Urine samples were analyzed for: ioduria and BPs. Ultrasound examination of thyroid gland was performed. One hundred eighty participants were included into the study. A negative correlation was found between urine BPC and the thyroid volume (R =¬†-0.258; p =¬†0.0005).

22447239,-140,fipronil,Thyroid,CYP450-dependent biotransformation of the insecticide fipronil into fipronil sulfone can mediate fipronil-induced thyroid disruption in rats.,"In rats, the widely used insecticide fipronil increases the clearance of thyroxine (T(4)). This effect is associated with a high plasma concentration of fipronil sulfone, the fipronil main metabolite in several species including rats and humans. In sheep, following fipronil treatment, fipronil sulfone plasma concentration and thyroid disruption are much lower than in rats. We postulated that fipronil biotransformation into fipronil sulfone by hepatic cytochromes P450 (CYP) could act as a potential thyroid disruptor. The aim of this study was to determine if fipronil sulfone treatment could reproduce the fipronil treatment effects on T(4) clearance and CYP induction in rats. Fipronil and fipronil sulfone treatments (3.4 mol/kg/day per os, 14 days) increased total and free T(4) clearances to the same extent in THX + T(3), euthyroid-like rats. Both treatments induced a 2.5-fold increase in Ugt1a1 and Sult1b1 messenger RNA (mRNA) expressions and a twofold increase in UGT1A activity suggesting that T(4) elimination was mediated, at least in part, by hepatic uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) and/or sulfotransferases (SULT) induction. Both treatments induced a 10-fold increase in Cyp3a1 and Cyp2b2 mRNA expressions concomitant with a threefold increase in CYP3A immunoreactivity and a 1.7-fold increase in antipyrine clearance, a biomarker of CYP3A activity. All these results showed that fipronil sulfone treatment could reproduce the fipronil treatment effects on T(4) clearance and hepatic enzyme induction in rats. The potential of fipronil sulfone to act as a thyroid disruptor is all the more critical because it persists much longer in the organism than fipronil itself.","Endocrine Disruptors,Insecticides,Pyrazoles,Thyroid Hormones,Ugt1a1 protein, rat,Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System,Glucuronosyltransferase,Sulfotransferases,iodothyronine sulfotransferase,fipronil sulfone,fipronil",,"Adult,Amygdala,Female,Hippocampus,Humans,Hyponatremia,Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Male,Middle Aged,Neurosecretory Systems,Organ Size,Polyuria,Schizophrenia,Third Ventricle,Thirst"

Currently, mitochondrial abnormality is a new paradigm for evaluating chemical-mediated metabolic disruption. However, a comprehensive correlation between these two aspects of OPFR remains elusive. In the work reported here, 3 markers for morphological abnormality, and 7 markers of mitochondrial dysfunction were detected after treatment with two aryl-OPFRs (TCP and TPhP) and three chlorinated-OPFRs (TDCPP, TCPP, and TCEP) on hepatocyte. The two aryl-OPFRs and TDCPP can cause intracellular lipid accumulation at non-cytotoxic concentrations (<10\xa0ŒºM), while the other two chlorinated-OPFRs only caused lipid deposition at 10\xa0ŒºM. Furthermore, at the tested concentrations, all of them reduced mitochondrial (mito)-network numbers, enlarged mito-area/cells, and skewed mitoATP/glycoATP. Excluding TCEP, the other four chemicals induced mito-ROS and depleted mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Notably, only TCP, TPhP and TDCPP impeded mitoATP generation rate and mito-respiratory rate.

Furthermore, 8-OHdG, the biomarker of DNA damage, was found to be a major mediator (>60%) for the association between neonatal TSH and DPHP, suggesting that DNA damage is involved in fetal thyroid function disruption. On the other hand, MDA showed a partially suppressing effect (<40%) for the associations between mOPEs and neonatal TSH, which needs further clarification. For maternal TSH, both 8-OHdG and MDA showed moderate mediating effects while the direct effects of mOPEs on maternal TSH also contributed.

BAFL has been widely used as material to synthetize polymers, such as polyimides, polyamide, and polyamine, for various uses since the 1970s. Here, we assessed the antiestrogenicity of BAFL using a variety of methods and looked into its impacts on the development of females in CD-1 mice. With the aid of a yeast estrogen screen assay, we found BAFL possessed obviously antiestrogenic activity (IC =\xa08.15\xa0√ó\xa010 M), which close to that of tamoxifen and BHPF. Using a 10-d mouse uterotrophic assay, we found that BAFL obviously decreased uterine weight in a dose-dependent way. Histological analyses of mouse uteri revealed that BAFL induced marked endometrial atrophy and inhibited the uterine development. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that Sprr2d, an estrogen-responsive gene encoding protein, was mainly expressed in endometrial epithelial cells and BAFL decreased the areas and levels of Sprr2d staining in mouse uteri. It was clear from uterine transcriptome investigations that BAFL significantly downregulated the expressions of multiple genes responding to estrogen. Molecular docking showed that BAFL could effectively occupy the antagonist-binding pocket of hERŒ±, and one of the amino groups of BAFL formed hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Arg394 and Glu353 in the receptor. These results indicated that BAFL exhibited clearly antiestrogenic characteristics and could interfere with normal female development in mice, which should be avoided using in commodities that come into direct contact with humans.

36098747,-140,bisphenol AF,Reproductive,Effects of low-dose bisphenol AF on mammal testis development via complex mechanisms: alterations are detectable in both infancy and adulthood.,"Despite growing concern about adverse effects of bisphenol AF (BPAF) due to its endocrine disrupting properties, there is a lack of toxicity data from low-dose studies and direct evidence linking its adverse effects to endocrine disrupting properties. Here, we investigated the effects of gestational and postnatal exposure to BPAF through drinking water (0.15-15¬†Œºg/mL, equivalent to the daily intake of‚Äâ~‚Äâ50 and 5¬†mg/kg/day) on testis development in mice. We found that like mestranol, 5¬†mg/kg/day BPAF resulted in remarkable decreases in multiple male reproductive parameters in adulthood, such as the sperm number and serum testosterone level. Notably, 50¬†Œºg/kg/day BPAF also caused significant decreases in anogenital distance (AGD), the luteinizing hormone level and spermatocyte number, along with declining trends in sperm number and the serum levels of testosterone and follicle-stimulating hormone. In line with the adverse outcomes observed in adulthood, on postnatal day (PND) 9, we also observed BPAF-caused dose-dependent alterations, including reduced AGD, seminiferous tubule area and numbers of total germ cells, spermatocytes and Leydig cells, coupled with down-regulated expression of male-biased genes in testes. Even when exposure to 5¬†mg/kg/day BPAF as well as MES was initiated from PND 0, similar alterations in male reproductive parameters were also found on PND 9, along with a decrease in the GnRH content in the hypothalamus; moreover, testicular alterations and the reduction in AGD were partly antagonized by the estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist ICI 182,780, but the reduction of GnRH production was not done, showing that the effects of BPAF on testis development may be partially mediated by ER signaling. In conclusion, all the findings demonstrate that low-dose BPAF can partly disrupt mammal testis development and cause adverse testicular outcomes in adulthood, indicating a potential reproductive risk to mammals including humans. Importantly, our finding that developmental alterations elicited by BPAF have been detectable on PND 9 provides important motivation for the development of effective methods for early detection of adverse effects of estrogenic chemicals on testis development.","4,4'-hexafluorisopropylidene diphenol,Drinking Water,Mestranol,Fulvestrant,Receptors, Estrogen,Benzhydryl Compounds,Follicle Stimulating Hormone,Testosterone,Luteinizing Hormone,Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone","behavior,brain,development,maternal deprivation,programming,stress","Adult,Animals,Behavior, Animal,Brain,Child, Preschool,Female,Humans,Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System,Maternal Behavior,Maternal Deprivation,Neurosecretory Systems,Pituitary-Adrenal System,Stress, Psychological"

The main purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of perinatal exposure to BPA on the onset of puberty and reproductive function, and its mechanism from the aspect of autophagy and inflammation in ovarian and uterus tissues of female offspring. Twenty-one pregnant SD rats were randomly divided into three groups: Control group, 1‚ÄØŒºg/mL BPA (LBPA) and 10‚ÄØŒºg/mL BPA group (HBPA) via drinking water from gestational day 6 to the end of lactation.

The levels of E2, LH, FSH, T, and IL-6 and TNF-Œ±, and the onset of puberty, and morphological changes in ovarian and uterine were determined in female offspring at 8 weeks. The levels of TLR4, NF-Œ∫B, PI3K/Akt/mTOR and autophagy related protein in uterine tissue were also detected. Our results indicated that perinatal exposure to BPA advanced puberty, which was associated with increased serum E2, LH and FSH levels. There was a significantly thin endometrium epithelium in HBPA group compared with control group, which may affect reproductive function. The adverse effect of perinatal BPA exposure on reproductive function maybe was associated with the activation of inflammation and abnormal autophagy via TLR4/NF-Œ∫B and mTOR signaling pathways respectively in female offspring.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Hormones,NF-kappa B,Phenols,Tlr4 protein, rat,Toll-Like Receptor 4,mTOR protein, rat,TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases,bisphenol A","adverse health outcomes,air pollution,benzene exposure,developmental toxicity,endocrine disruptors,energy homeostasis,gestational exposure,glucose metabolism,inflammation,offspring diabetes","Adult,Animals,Benzene,Female,Humans,Insulin,Insulin Resistance,Male,Maternal Exposure,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Pregnancy,Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects"

Here, we investigated effects of BHPF on steroidogenesis using human adrenocortical carcinoma cells (H295R). Cytotoxicity was initially assessed and half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC) was determined based on proliferation of cells. Responses of four steroid hormones, aldosterone, cortisol, testosterone and 17Œ≤-estradiol (E), and ten critical genes, StAR, HMGR, CYP11A1, CYP11B1, CYP11B1, HSD3B2, CYP21, CYP17, 17Œ≤-HSD, and CYP19, involved in steroidogenesis after exposure to non-cytotoxic concentrations of BHPF were determined in the presence or absence of 100\xa0ŒºM dbcAMP. Adenylate cyclase (AC) activity, intracellular concentrations of cAMP, PKA activity and amounts of steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) gene and expressions of proteins were determined to elucidate underlying mechanisms of effects on steroidogenesis. BHPF was cytotoxic to H295R cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Effects on production of hormones results demonstrated that exposure to greater concentrations of BHPF inhibited productions of aldosterone, cortisol, testosterone and E by down-regulation of steroidogenic genes. Inhibition of AC activity, intercellular cAMP content and PKA activity after exposure to BHPF implied that the AC/cAMP/PKA signaling pathway was involved in BHPF-induced suppression of steroidogenesis in H295R cells. Additionally, BHPF inhibited steroidogenesis and expressions of steroidogenic genes via decreasing expression of SF-1 protein, both in basal and dbcAMP-induced treatment.

33254415,-139,benzo(a)pyrene,Reproductive,Melatonin alleviates benzo(a)pyrene-induced ovarian corpus luteum dysfunction by suppressing excessive oxidative stress and apoptosis.,"Benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) is a widespread persistent organic pollutant (POP) and a well-known endocrine disruptor. Exposure to BaP is known to disrupt the steroid balance and impair embryo implantation, but the mechanism under it remains unclear. The corpus luteum (CL), the primary source of progesterone during early pregnancy, plays a pivotal role in embryo implantation and pregnancy maintenance. The inappropriate luteal function may result in implantation failure and spontaneous abortions. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess the effects and potential mechanisms of B(a)P on the CL function. Our results showed that pregnant mice received B(a)P displayed impaired embryo implantation and dysfunction of ovarian CL. The estrogen and progesterone levels decreased by B(a)P. In vitro, exposure to BPDE, which is the metabolite of B(a)P, affected the luteinization of granular cell KK-1. Additionally, melatonin and its receptors, which are important for ovarian function and anti-oxidative damage, were affected by B(a)P or BPDE. B(a)P or BPDE-treated alone impaired antioxidant capacity of ovarian granulosa cells, caused an increasing of ROS and cell apoptosis, and disrupted the PI3K/AKT/GSK3Œ≤ signaling pathway in vivo and in vitro. Co-treatment with melatonin alleviated B(a)P or BPDE-induced CL dysfunction by ameliorating oxidative stress, counteracting phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT/GSK3Œ≤ signaling pathway, decreasing the apoptosis of the ovarian cells. Moreover, activation of the melatonin receptor by ramelteon in KK-1 cells exhibits an analogous protective effect as melatonin. In conclusion, our findings not only firstly clarify the potential mechanisms of BaP-induced CL dysfunction, but also extend the understanding about the ovarian protection of melatonin and its receptors against B(a)P exposure.","Antioxidants,Endocrine Disruptors,Benzo(a)pyrene,Progesterone,Melatonin","Ecosocial,Globalization,India,Polycystic ovary syndrome,South Asia,Structural vulnerabilities,Women's health","Adult,Anthropology, Cultural,Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2,Female,Humans,India,Infertility, Female,Internationality,Interviews as Topic,Life Style,Male,Middle Aged,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,Prevalence,Social Class"

Here, we assessed in mouse models, the intrinsic and exogenous ligand-induced AhR action on E2 synthesis at the infantile stage (14 days postnatal (dpn)) and at the approach of puberty (28 dpn). Intrinsic AhR pathway became activated in the ovary at the approach of puberty, as suggested by the decreased intra-ovarian expression in prototypical and steroidogenesis-related AhR targets and E2 contents in Ahr knockout (Ahr) mice versus Ahr mice exclusively at 28 dpn. Accordingly, AhR nuclear localization in granulosa cells, reflecting its activity in cells responsible for E2 synthesis, was much lower at 14 dpn than at 28 dpn in C57BL/6 mice. However, AhR signaling could be activated by exogenous ligands at both ages, as revealed by FICZ- and TCDD-induced Ahrr and Cyp1a1 expression in C57BL/6 mice. Nevertheless, TCDD impacted ovarian estrogenic activity only at 28 dpn. This age-related AhR action may be ligand-dependent, since FICZ had no effect on E2 synthesis at 28 dpn.

Even though many TBT effects in marine species are known, data in mammals are scarce, especially regarding the thyroid gland. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of a subchronic exposure to TBT on thyroid oxidative stress of female Wistar rats. Rats received vehicle (control group), 200 or 1000¬†ng TBT/kg body weight/day for 40 days. After euthanasia, one part of the thyroids were collected in order to assess iodide uptake; activity and/or mRNA expression of thyroperoxidase (TPO) and dual oxidases (DUOXs); activity and/or mRNA expression of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and NADPH oxidase 4 (CAT, GPx, SOD and NOX4); 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) expression and total thiol groups levels; and mRNA expression of estrogen receptors alpha and beta (ERŒ± and ERŒ≤). The remaining part of the thyroid was processed for morphological analysis of estrogen receptor alpha (ERŒ±) and for collagen deposition. Iodide uptake was not changed with treatments. TPO activity and expression were increased in the TBT1000 group (259.81% and 95.17%). The activity, but not mRNA, of CAT (17.36% TBT200; 27.10% TBT1000) and GPx (29.24% TBT200; 28.97% TBT1000) were decreased by TBT. SOD and NADPH oxidase activity, as well as thiol group and 4-HNE levels remained unchanged. Interstitial collagen deposition increased in the TBT200 group (39.54%). The mRNA expression of ERŒ± increased in TBT-treated rats (44.87% TBT200; 36.43% TBT1000), while protein expression was increased but not reaching significance (TBT1000, p¬†=¬†0.056) by TBT. Therefore, our results show that TBT increases TPO expression and reduces antioxidant enzyme activities in the thyroid gland leading to oxidative stress.

Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a commonly used plasticizer that has raised much concern owing to its ubiquitous pollution and endocrine-disrupting potential. This study aimed to investigate the toxic effects on the male reproductive system upon coexposure to NPs and DEHP. The C57BL/6J mice were orally administrated with polystyrene nanoparticles (PSNPs), DEHP or both for 35 days to evaluate their effects on sperm quality, histology of testes and epididymides, testicular transcriptomic characteristics as well as expression of some important genes in the epididymides. The low-dose PSNPs used here did not induce significant changes in sperm quality, while DEHP alone or cotreatment with DEHP and PSNPs caused notable impairment, mainly manifesting as decreased sperm quality and aberrant structure of the testis and epididymis. Moreover, enhanced toxic effects were found in the cotreatment group when compared with the individual DEHP treatment group, as manifested by more obvious alterations in the sperm parameters as well as histological changes in the testis and epididymis. Testicular transcriptomic analysis revealed differential regulation of genes involved in immune response, cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor signaling pathways, protein ubiquitination, oxidative stress, necrotic cell death, ATP synthesis and the cellular respiratory chain. RT-qPCR verified that the expression patterns of Cenpb, Crisp1 and Mars were changed in testes, and genes relevant to epididymal function including Aqp9 and Octn2 were downregulated in epididymides, particularly in the cotreatment group.

The current study was designed to explore the probable reproductive damage induced by DEP and the therapeutic efficacy of raw honey in male albino mice. Four-week-old 50 male mice were randomized equally in five groups, as control (C) received 0.1 ml distilled water; vehicle control (VC) received corn oil (0.1 ml/mouse); DEP (3mg/g/BW) dissolved in corn oil; honey control (HC) administered with honey (0.2 mg/g/day); and phthalate plus honey (P+H) administered with DEP and honey (3mg and 0.2 mg/g/BW/day respectively). Mice were treated through oral gavage for 54 days routinely, acclimatized for 6 days, and dissected. In the first instance, the antioxidant potential and total phenolic contents (TPC) of honey were analyzed through ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay and Folin-Ciocalteu assay to confirm the antioxidant capacity of honey. The morphological, morphometric, histological, micrometric, sperm count, and hormonal analyses, and antioxidant capacity test in tissue homogenates were conducted by using tissues (testis, epididymis) and blood samples of mice. Mice exposed to DEP have a significant increase in body weight, LH level, and seminiferous tubule lumen diameter and decrease in the gonado-somatic index, testosterone level, sperm count, and seminiferous tubule diameter. Additionally, histopathology of testes showed interstitial space dilations, exfoliations, Leydig cell atrophy, germ cell degenerations, and spermatid retention in DEP-exposed testes sections. However, concomitant use of honey and DEP had shown a significant improvement in histopathological lesions, steroid hormone levels, and healthy sperm count. By these results, it is concluded that honey possessed antioxidant potential that can efficiently protect DEP-induced anomalies in male mice.","Carcinogens,Gonadal Steroid Hormones,Phthalic Acids,diethyl phthalate","Benzophenone-3,Bisphenol A,Cardiovascular disease,Environmental phenols,Triclosan","Adult,Benzhydryl Compounds,Cardiovascular Diseases,Cross-Sectional Studies,Environmental Exposure,Humans,Nutrition Surveys,Phenols,Prevalence,Tandem Mass Spectrometry,Triclosan"

However, whether prenatal exposure to DBP can impair erectile function remains unknown. We conducted this study to investigate the potential effects of prenatal exposure to DBP on erectile function and the underlying mechanisms. A rat model of prenatal DBP exposure (12.5, 100 or 800¬†mg/kg/day by gavage during gestational days 13-21) was established. Prenatal DBP exposure significantly decreased penis/body weight ratio, myelin sheath thickness of cavernosum nerves and serum testosterone level in male rats at the age of 10 weeks. Furthermore, erectile dysfunction was detected in all DBP exposure groups, which exhibited substantial increases in transforming growth factor-Œ≤1 (TGF-Œ≤1) expression and decreases in the expression of alpha smooth muscle actin (Œ±-SMA), neuronal and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (nNOS and eNOS). Additionally, the phospho-B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-associated death promoter (p-Bad)/Bad and phospho-the protein kinase B (p-AKT)/AKT ratios were remarkably lower, but the Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax)/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3 were higher in DBP exposure groups than in the control group. Notably, prenatal exposure to DBP increase the risk of ED in male adult rats, even taking low dose of DBP (12.5¬†mg/kg/day). DBP exposure causing penile fibrosis, decreased testosterone level, and endothelial dysfunction may be responsible for ED by activating Akt/Bad/Bax/caspase-3 pathway and suppressing NOS/cGMP pathway in penis.","Environmental Pollutants,Dibutyl Phthalate,Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III,Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt","Bisphenol A (BPA),Endocrine disruptor,Meta-analysis,Serum,Systematic review,Urine","Adult,Benzhydryl Compounds,Creatinine,Humans"

Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and chlorpyrifos (CPF) act as endocrine disruptors, inducing proliferation in breast cancer cells. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and nitric oxide (NO) are associated with angiogenesis. Our aim was to evaluate HCB and CPF action, both weak aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligands, on angiogenesis in breast cancer models. We used: (1) in vivo xenograft model with MCF-7 cells, (2) in vitro breast cancer model with MCF-7, and (3) in vitro neovasculogenesis model with endothelial cells exposed to conditioned medium from MCF-7. Results show that HCB (3‚ÄØmg/kg) and CPF (0.1‚ÄØmg/kg) stimulated vascular density in the in vivo model. HCB and CPF low doses enhanced VEGF-A and COX-2 expression, accompanied by increased levels of nitric oxide synthases (NOS), and NO release in MCF-7. HCB and CPF high doses intensified VEGF-A and COX-2 levels but rendered different effects on NOS, however, both pesticides reduced NO production. Moreover, our data indicate that HCB and CPF-induced VEGF-A expression is mediated by estrogen receptor and NO, while the increase in COX-2 is through AhR and NO pathways in MCF-7. In conclusion, we demonstrate that HCB and CPF environmental concentrations stimulate angiogenic switch in vivo. Besides, pesticides induce VEGF-A and COX-2 expression, as well as NO production in MCF-7, promoting tubulogenesis in endothelial cells. These findings show that pesticide exposure could stimulate angiogenesis, a process that has been demonstrated to contribute to breast cancer progression.","AHR protein, human,Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors,Fungicides, Industrial,Insecticides,Ligands,Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon,Hexachlorobenzene,Chlorpyrifos","cortisol,electromyography,feeding,mother‚Äìinfant interaction,Œ±-amylase","Adult,Biomarkers,Breast Feeding,Feeding Behavior,Female,Humans,Hydrocortisone,Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System,Infant,Mother-Child Relations,Pilot Projects,Pituitary-Adrenal System,Saliva,Stress, Psychological,alpha-Amylases"

For this purpose, female Sprague-Dawley rats were administered environmentally relevant PBDE-47 levels (0.1, 1.0, 10\xa0mg/kg/day) by oral gavage from prepregnancy through lactation cessation to achieve early-life exposure of offspring and to mimic the actual exposure. Sperm quantity and motility together with serum THs levels from male offspring were determined on postnatal day 88. In utero and lactational exposure to PBDE-47 boosted the weight gain while reduced the relative testis weight in adult male offspring. These were accompanied with the reductions in sperm counts (total and living sperm counts), the percentage of progressive sperm motility, sperm velocities (curvilinear velocity, straight-line velocity and average path velocity), motion path (beat cross frequency, linearity and wobble) and linear motile sperm parameters (count, motility and concentration). Further studies identified that the levels of serum triiodothyronine (T) were increased by PBDE-47 exposure and negatively associated with those differential semen parameters on quantity and motility.

Our results revealed that NP brought down the activities of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GSR), while elevated the level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). Additionally, NP decreased the level of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), plasma testosterone, daily sperm production (DSP), epididymal sperm count, viability, motility, gene expression of testicular steroidogenic enzymes (StAR, 3Œ≤-HSD and 17Œ≤-HSD) and anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-2), as well as number of spermatogenic cells belonging to various stages. Whereas, sperm (head, mid-piece/neck and tail) abnormalities, expression of apoptotic proteins (Bax and caspase-3), and histopathological damages were increased. However, NOB remarkably reversed all the damages caused by NP. Therefore, it is deduced that NOB could be used as a potential therapeutic to counter the NP-prompted oxidative stress and apoptotic damages in testes.","Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins,Endocrine Disruptors,Flavones,Phenols,Protective Agents,Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances,nonylphenol,nobiletin,Oxidoreductases","NAFLD progression,PNPLA3,endocrine disruptors,inborn errors associated with NAFLD,intestinal failure-associated liver disease,nutrition-associated,secondary NAFLD,toxicant-associated","Adult,Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury,Child,Comorbidity,Endocrine System Diseases,Female,Gastrointestinal Diseases,Genetic Diseases, Inborn,Genetic Predisposition to Disease,Hepacivirus,Hepatitis C, Chronic,Humans,Male,Metabolic Syndrome,Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease,Obesity, Abdominal,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Complications,Risk Factors,Young Adult"

Plasma concentrations of thyroid hormones (THs), hepatic deiodinase type 1 (D1) activity, and transcription of selected TH-related genes in liver were used as markers of HPT axis changes. Liver concentrations of a certain PBDE congeners and other FRs including pentabromoethylbenzene (PBEB), dechlorane 602 (Dec-602), and dechlorane plus (DP) were associated with changes in thyroid status. Specifically, liver PBDE, PBEB and Dec-602 concentrations were associated with plasma TH levels (free thyroxine [FT] and total triiodothyronine [TT]). Liver DP concentrations were positively correlated with the TT:FT ratios and mRNA levels of UDP-glucuronyltransferase-1, while those of PBEB were negatively associated with TT:TT ratios and D1 activity. D1 activity was also positively associated with the tri-, tetra- and hexa-BDE congeners. Moreover, transcription of ABCC2, a hepatic TH transporter, was associated with certain liver PBDE concentrations. Although PBDEs and other FRs may be potential inhibitors of D1 activity, only a few of the targeted FRs had modest associations with hepatic D1 activity.

Mice from F1 and F2 offspring were used to generate F3 males. Prenatal exposure to BPA, BPE, and BPS decreased sperm counts and/or motility and disrupted the progression of germ cell development as morphometric analyses exhibited an abnormal distribution of the stages of spermatogenesis in F3 males. Dysregulated serum levels of estradiol-17Œ≤ and testosterone, as well as expression of steroidogenic enzymes in F3 adult testis were also observed. In the neonatal testis, although apoptosis and DNA damage were not affected, mRNA levels of DNA methyltransferases, histone methyltransferases, and their associated factors were increased by BP exposure. Furthermore, BP exposure induced immunoreactive expression of DNMT3A in Sertoli cells, strengthened DNMT3B, and weakened H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 in germ cells of the neonatal testis, whereas DNMT1, H3K4me3, and H3K27ac were not affected. In adult testis, stage-specific DNMT3B was altered by BP exposure, although DNMT3A, H3K9me2, and H3K9me3 expression remained stable.

The accumulated BPA in humans is toxic to osteoblasts and osteoclasts, but few studies focused on the effects of BPA on osteocytes, the most abundant bone cell type, contributing to the development and metabolism of bone. Here, we reported that BPA (50, 100, 200 Œºmol/L) inhibited the cell viability of osteocytes MLO-Y4, promoted G0/G1 phase arrest and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. BPA treatment significantly increased the levels of autophagy-regulated proteins including Beclin-1 and LC3-II along with the decrease of p62, accompanied by the elevation of autophagy flux and the accumulation of acidic vacuoles, which was blocked by the autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (BafA1). Furthermore, BPA significantly inhibited the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and activated Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1) signaling, leading to the decreased p-mTOR/mTOR ratio and the increased p-ULK1/ULK1 ratio. The mTOR activator MHY1485 (MHY) or the ULK1 inhibitor SBI-0206965 (SBI) prevented autophagy and enhanced apoptosis caused by BPA, respectively. In addition, BPA increased the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) and decreased antioxidant enzymes nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) levels, resulting in oxidative stress. The ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) attenuated BPA-induced the mTOR/ULK1 pathway activation, apoptosis and autophagy.

In this study, we investigated whether CPF could behave as a predisposing factor for tumors to become more metastatic and aggressive using 3D culture models. In MCF-7¬†cells, 0.05¬†ŒºM CPF induced an increase in the number and size of mammospheres via estrogen receptor alpha (ERŒ±) and c-SRC. Furthermore, 0.05¬†ŒºM CPF increased the area of spheroids generated from MCF-7¬†cells, induced invasion using both Matrigel¬Æ and type 1 collagen matrices, and increased cell migration capacity via ERŒ± in this 3D model. In turn, 50¬†ŒºM CPF increased cell migration capacity and invasion using type 1 collagen matrix. In monolayers, CPF increased the phosphorylation and membrane translocation of c-SRC at both concentrations assayed. CPF at 0.05¬†ŒºM boosted p-AKT, p-GSK-3Œ≤ and p-P38. While p-AKT rose in a ERŒ±-dependent way, p-GSK-3Œ≤ was dependent on ERŒ±- and c-SRC, and p-P38 was only dependent on c-SRC. On the other hand, the increase in p-AKT and p-P38 induced by 50¬†ŒºM CPF was dependent on the c-SRC pathway. We also observed that 0.05¬†ŒºM CPF increased IGF-1R and IRS-1 expression and that 50¬†ŒºM CPF induced IGF-1RŒ≤ phosphorylation. In the MDA-MB-231¬†cell line, 0.05 and 50¬†ŒºM CPF increased p-c-SRC. Finally, p-AKT and p-GSK-3Œ≤ were also induced by CPF at 0.05 and 50¬†ŒºM, and an increase in p-P38 was observed at 50¬†ŒºM.

It is an alternative to di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), a well-known reprotoxic and endocrine disruptor. As plasticizers are known to easily migrate when in contact with fatty biological fluids, patient exposure to TEHTM is highly probable. However, there is currently no data on the potential endocrine-disrupting effects of its human metabolites. To evaluate the effects of TEHTM metabolites on endocrine activity, they were first synthesized and their effects on estrogen, androgen and thyroid receptors, as well as steroid synthesis, were investigated by combining in vitro and in silico approaches. Among the primary metabolites, only 4-MEHTM (4-mono-(2-ethylhexyl) trimellitate) showed agonist activities on ERs and TRs, while three diesters were TR antagonists at non-cytotoxic concentrations. These results were completed by docking experiments which specified the ER and TR isoforms involved. A mixture of 2/1-MEHTM significantly increased the estradiol level and reduced the testosterone level in H295R cell culture supernatants. The oxidized secondary metabolites of TEHTM had no effect on ER, AR, TR receptors or on steroid hormone synthesis. Among the fourteen metabolites, these data showed that two of them (4-MEHTM and 2/1-MEHTM) induced effect on hormonal activities in vitro. However, by comparing the concentrations of the primary metabolites found in human urine with the active concentrations determined in bioassays, it can be suggested that the metabolites will not be active with regard to estrogen, androgen, thyroid receptors and steroidogenesis-mediated effects.","Benzoates,Endocrine Disruptors,Plasticizers,Receptors, Androgen,Receptors, Estrogen,Receptors, Thyroid Hormone,tri-(2-ethylhexyl)trimellitate,Testosterone,Estradiol","Antepartum,Cortisol,Depression,Estradiol,Estrogens,Gestation,Pregnancy,Working memory","Adult,Cognition,Depression,Estradiol,Executive Function,Female,Humans,Memory Disorders,Memory, Short-Term,Postpartum Period,Prefrontal Cortex,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Complications,Sleep,Young Adult"

BPA exposure especially occupational perinatal exposure to has been linked to numerous adverse effects for the offspring. Available data have shown that perinatal exposure to BPA contributes to neurodegenerative pathological changes; however, the potential mechanisms remain unclear. This study attempted to investigate the long-term consequences of perinatal exposure to BPA on the offspring mouse brain. The pregnant mice were given either a vehicle control or BPA (2, 10, 100 Œºg/kg/d) from day 6 of gestation until weaning (P6-PND21, foetal and neonatal exposure). At 3, 6 and 9 months of age, the neurotoxic effects in the offspring in each group were investigated. We found that the spine density but not the dendritic branches in the hippocampus were noticeably reduced at 6 and 9 months of age. Meanwhile, p-Tau, the characteristic protein for tauopathy, was dramatically increased in both the hippocampus and cortex at 3-9 months of age. Mechanically, the balance of kinase and protein phosphatase, which plays critical roles in p-Tau regulation, was disturbed. It indicated that GSK3Œ≤ and CDK5, two critical kinases, were activated in most of the BPA perinatal exposure group, while protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), one of the important phosphatases, regulated p-Tau expression through its demethylation, methylation and phosphorylation. Taken together, the present study may be translatable to the human occupational BPA exposure due to a similar exposure level. BPA perinatal exposure causes long-term adverse effects on the mouse brain and may be a risk factor for tauopathies, and the CDK5/GSK3Œ≤/PP2A axis might be a promising therapeutic target for BPA-induced neurodegenerative pathological changes.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Mapt protein, mouse,Phenols,tau Proteins,Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5,Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta,Gsk3b protein, mouse,Cdk5 protein, mouse,Protein Phosphatase 2,bisphenol A","Hormones,Infants,Phthalate exposure,Reproductive markers","Adult,Cohort Studies,Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Pollutants,Female,Humans,Infant,Male,Maternal Exposure,Phthalic Acids,Pregnancy,Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects,Reproduction,Tandem Mass Spectrometry,Testosterone"

Nevertheless, as a potential chemical contaminant of the environment, its impact on female reproductive system remains to be investigated. The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of AA on ovary and to investigate the further cellular mechanism. Primarily, in vitro cultured mouse ovary granulosa cells (GCs) were treated with AA at a concentration of 10ŒºM for 24‚Äâh. The cells and supernatant were collected and subjected to further measures. The results demonstrated that after being treated with 10ŒºM AA for 24‚Äâh the levels of estradiol and progesterone in supernatant were down-regulated. And excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and declined antioxidant capacity were also determined. Additionally, a large number of apoptotic bodies and autophagic vesicles were found in the experimental cells, and the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway was demonstrated to play a main role in GCs apoptosis. To further investigate the effect of AA on ovary, the female ICR mice were administered with AA (10‚Äâmg/ kg bodyweight) intraperitoneally for successive 35 days, and the estrus phase was recorded simultaneously. After exposure, the ovaries and blood samples were collected for further analysis. The results revealed that the estrus period of the mice was shortened and the interestrus period was extended after being treated with AA for 35 days. At the organismal level, the numbers of antral follicles and atresia follicles increased and the levels of pro-apoptosis and autophagy-related proteins were detected upregulated after AA treatment.

An estimated 6.5 million Michigan residents consumed polybrominated biphenyl (PBB)-laced animal products leading to one of the largest agricultural accidents in U.S. history. To date, there have been no studies investigating the effects of PBB on epigenetic regulation in sperm, which could explain some of the endocrine-related health effects observed among children of PBB-exposed parents. Fusing epidemiological approaches with a novel in vitro model of human spermatogenesis, we demonstrate that exposure to PBB153, the primary component of FireMaster, alters the epigenome in human spermatogenic cells. Using our novel stem cell-based spermatogenesis model, we show that PBB153 exposure decreases DNA methylation at regulatory elements controlling imprinted genes. Furthermore, PBB153 affects DNA methylation by reducing de novo DNA methyltransferase activity at increasing PBB153 concentrations as well as reducing maintenance DNA methyltransferase activity at the lowest tested PBB153 concentration. Additionally, PBB153 exposure alters the expression of genes critical to proper human development. Taken together, these results suggest that PBB153 exposure alters the epigenome by disrupting methyltransferase activity leading to defects in imprint establishment causing altered gene expression, which could contribute to health concerns in the children of men exposed to PBB153.

36230992,-135,Di-n-Butyl Phthalate,Reproductive,Di-n-Butyl Phthalate and Its Monoester Metabolite Impairs Steroid Hormone Biosynthesis in Human Cells: Mechanistic In Vitro Studies.,"The widespread environmental contaminant di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) has been linked with reduced testosterone levels and adverse reproductive health outcomes in men. However, the underlying mechanisms of these anti-androgenic effects and the potential effects on other classes of steroid hormones remain to be elucidated. Here, we conducted mechanistic studies in human adrenocortical H295R cells exposed to 1-500 ¬µM of DBP or its metabolite, mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP), for 48 h. Quantification of steroid hormones in the cell medium by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed that both phthalates significantly decreased testosterone, androstenedione, corticosterone, and progesterone levels, in particular after dibutyryl-cyclic-AMP stimulation of steroidogenesis. Western blot analysis of key steroidogenic proteins showed that DBP induced a dose-dependent decrease of CYP11A1 and HSD3Œ≤2 levels, while MBP only significantly decreased CYP17A1 levels, indicating that the compounds affect early steps of the steroidogenesis differently. Both DBP and MBP exposure also lead to a dose-related decrease in HSD17Œ≤3, the enzyme which catalyzes the final step in the testosterone biosynthesis pathway, although these effects were not statistically significant. Interestingly, DBP increased the cortisol concentration, which may be due to the non-significant CYP11B1 increase in DBP-exposed cells. In contrast, MBP decreased cortisol concentration. Moreover, the analysis of superoxide generation and quantification of the protein oxidation marker nitrotyrosine demonstrated that DBP induced oxidative stress in H295R cells while MBP reduced protein nitrotyrosine levels. These findings confirm the anti-androgenic effects of DBP and MBP and reveal several differences in their toxicological mechanisms, with possible implications for future research on phthalate toxicity.","Phthalic Acids,Steroids,Superoxides,Dibutyl Phthalate,Testosterone,Androstenedione,Adenosine Monophosphate,Progesterone,phthalic acid,Steroid 11-beta-Hydroxylase,Cholesterol Side-Chain Cleavage Enzyme,Corticosterone,Hydrocortisone,monobutyl phthalate","DNA methylome,IED,inflammation,pathway analysis","Adult,DNA Methylation,Disruptive, Impulse Control, and Conduct Disorders,Epigenesis, Genetic,Epigenomics,Female,Gene Regulatory Networks,Genome-Wide Association Study,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,Psychiatric Status Rating Scales"

33484789,-135,Fenhexamid,Cancer,Fenhexamid induces cancer growth and survival via estrogen receptor-dependent and PI3K-dependent pathways in breast cancer models.,"Fenhexamid (Fen), a fungicide used to treat gray mold of fruits and vegetables, is reported to function as an endocrine disrupting chemical via the estrogen receptors (ER), despite low-toxicity of the pesticide. In this study, we elucidated that the disrupting effects of Fen are exerted via the ER and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways in breast cancer models. The WST assay, live cell monitoring, cell cycle analysis, colony formation assay, apoptotic analysis by JC-1 dyeing, and Western blot analysis were applied in ER positive MCF-7 and ER negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, after exposure to 17Œ≤-estradiol (E2), Fen, ICI 182,780 (ICI; an ER antagonist) and/or Pictilisib (Pic; a PI3K inhibitor). Exposure to E2 and Fen induced the cell growth and survival ability of MCF-7¬†cells by increasing the S-phase cells and regulating the cell cycle-related proteins (Cyclin D1 and E1, p21 and p27). In addition, E2 and Fen treatment resulted in elevated levels of the survival-related proteins (Survivin and PCNA), and inhibited apoptosis by increasing the mitochondrial membrane potential and regulating the apoptosis-related proteins (BAX, BCL-2, and Caspase-9). These changes were reversed to the same level as the control group when exposed to their respective inhibitors, thereby indicating that the changes are exerted via the ER and PI3K pathways. In particular, co-treatment with these inhibitors induced greater inhibition than single treatment. Conversely, no alterations were observed in the ER-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Taken together, these results indicate that Fen promotes the growth of breast cancer cells via the ER and/or PI3K pathways, similar to the E2 mechanism. Although a relatively safe pesticide, Fen possibly exerts its influence as an endocrine disrupting chemical in ER-positive breast cancer cells via the ER and PI3K pathways.","Amides,BAX protein, human,Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2,Receptors, Estrogen,bcl-2-Associated X Protein,N-(2,3-dichloro-4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-methylcyclohexanecarboxamide","Biology,Clinical Research,Comparative Studies,Contraception,Contraceptive Mode Of Action,Developed Countries,Endocrine System,Estradiol,Estrogens,Estrone,Europe,Family Planning,Gonadotropins,Gonadotropins, Pituitary,Hormone Antagonists,Hormones,Luteinizing Hormone,Menstrual Cycle,Menstruation,Northern Europe,Ovulation Suppression,Physiology,Prospective Studies,Reproduction,Research Methodology,Research Report,Ru-486,Scotland,Studies,United Kingdom","Adult,Estrogens, Conjugated (USP),Estrone,Female,Humans,Luteinizing Hormone,Mifepristone,Ovulation,Pituitary Hormones,Pituitary-Adrenal System,Pregnanediol,Steroids"

This study aimed at investigating the associations of BTRs and BTHs with estrogens and androgens among pregnant women. Based on a prospective cohort study, we included 459 pregnant women who donated a complete serial of urine samples at each trimester and had repeated measurements of four BTRs, four BTHs, three estrogens (estrone, 17Œ≤-estradiol, and estrio), and two androgens (dehydroepiandrosterone and testosterone) in the urine samples.

Tolyltriazole (TTR) (‚â•59.3%) and benzothiazole (BTH) (‚â•93.5%) had the highest detection rate among the BTRs and BTHs, respectively. Repeated measurement analysis and cross-sectional analysis consistently found the target BTRs and BTHs were positively associated with 17Œ≤-estradiol, estriol, and testosterone, while the trend of the associations with estrone and dehydroepiandrosterone was inconsistent. Among the positive associations with 17Œ≤-estradiol, estriol, and testosterone, the percent of change in estriol associated with TTR was the most prominent [28.5% (95% confidential interval: 24.2%, 32.9%) for each doubling in TTR].

Human populations may be exposed to phthalates through direct contact or environmental contamination. Most studies have focused on the effects of phthalates on the reproductive tract and have classified these compounds as endocrine disruptors. In this study, we aimed to investigate the possible oxidative damage induced by di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) in the mouse testis and to evaluate the regulatory effects of alpha-lipoic acid (LA). For this purpose, forty male mice were divided into four experimental groups. Group I received normal saline (2¬†mL/kg; p.o.) and corn oil (5¬†mL/kg; p.o.) as the control group, group II received DEHP (2¬†g/kg; p.o.), group III received DEHP and LA (20¬†mg/kg; p.o.), and group IV was treated with LA alone; treatments continued for 2¬†weeks. The glutathione level (GSH), as well as glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activities, was determined in mice. In addition, serum concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone, interleukin-1Œ≤ (IL-1Œ≤), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Œ±) were measured. Nitric oxide (NO) level, malondialdehyde (MDA) level, sperm characteristics, and histological changes of the testes were also evaluated. The results showed that 2¬†g/kg of DEHP could significantly decrease the sperm motility. Based on our findings, DEHP significantly reduced the production and count of sperms; these toxic effects were associated with alterations in the serum hormone levels. In the DEHP group, a significant reduction was reported in the serum testosterone, FSH, and LH levels. LA improved DEHP-induced changes in hormonal levels and sperm index. According to our findings, treatment with DEHP triggered histopathological changes and oxidative stress, which were normalized by LA pretreatment. In conclusion, DEHP disrupts the testicular function in rats, at least partly through induction of oxidative stress. On the other hand, LA exhibits potential protective effects on testicular toxicity induced by DEHP.","Phthalic Acids,phthalic acid,Thioctic Acid,Diethylhexyl Phthalate","AOP network,Adverse outcome pathway (AOP),Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs),Endocrine disruption,Graph theory,Risk assessment","Adverse Outcome Pathways,Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions,Humans,Risk Assessment"

However, the understanding of DEHP-induced lactation performance remains largely unknown. We sought to investigate the adverse effects of DEHP on lactation and examine the underlying mechanism linking DEHP exposure with the lactation alterations. We successfully adapted a maternal DEHP exposure model in female pregnant/lactating mice. Then we determined effects of DEHP exposure on food intake, body weight and milk production as well as the alterations in endocrine factors in lactating mice. The integrated metabonomic and transcriptomic analyses of the mammary gland were performed to measure the changed metabolites and genes related to DEHP exposure-induced lactation alterations. We observed the reduced food intake with elevated blood leptin and the decreased milk yield as well as the reduced levels of serum prolactin, growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor 1 and insulin after exposed to DEHP. Furthermore, 208 metabolites and 3452 genes were separately identified as differentially expressed features associated with DEHP exposure. Integrated metabonomic and transcriptomic analyses demonstrated that DEHP caused lactation depression mainly through impairing energy generation, inducing stress responses along with the hypoactivation of inflammation, reducing the production of antioxidants, disrupting hormone homeostasis and repressing the synthesis of milk constituents (the lower glucose availability for lactose synthesis; the disruption of milk fat globule membrane for lipid droplet formation; the ribosomal dysfunction and disruption of post-modifications for milk protein synthesis). We demonstrated that DEHP disrupted several lactation-related hormone homeostasis and multiple processes like energy insufficiency, inflammation activation, oxidative stress aggravation and disturbance of milk production in the mammary gland of female lactating mice. Our results provide valuable information for the health risk of plastic additive (DEHP) on female lactation dysfunction.","Insulin,Phthalic Acids,phthalic acid,Diethylhexyl Phthalate",,"Age Factors,Animals,Animals, Newborn,Conditioning, Classical,Corticosterone,Ibotenic Acid,Male,Neurons,Prefrontal Cortex,Rats,Rats, Wistar,Recovery of Function"

Xenoestrogens are synthetic or natural chemical compounds that have the ability to mimic estrogen and are ubiquitous in the food and water supply of developed countries.

Measurements of serum hormone levels revealed decreases in triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) in the AMT and PTU groups, an increase in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in the AMT, PTU, and AGT groups, and an increase in adrenocorticotrophic hormone in the AGT group. Increased thyroid, pituitary, and adrenal gland weights; histopathological lesions, including follicular hypertrophy/hyperplasia, hypertrophy/vacuolation of anterior pituitary cells, and increased adrenocortical vacuolation were observed in association with the hormone level changes. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a decreased T4 level in the thyroid gland of the AMT and PTU groups and an increased area of TSH positive immunostaining in the pituitary gland of the AMT, PTU, and AGT groups, consistent with the changes in serum T4 and TSH levels, respectively. These results suggest that histopathological analysis and immunohistochemistry for T4 and TSH might be useful and sensitive methods of detecting thyroid dysfunction, and that combining organ weight measurements is a reliable parameter of detecting endocrine disruptors.","Endocrine Disruptors,Triiodothyronine,Propylthiouracil,Thyrotropin,Thyroxine","Ageing,Blood pressure,Endothelin,Hypertension,Smooth muscle","Age Factors,Animals,Endothelin-1,GTP-Binding Proteins,Hypertension,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Muscle, Smooth, Vascular,Myocytes, Smooth Muscle,Receptor, Endothelin A,Signal Transduction"
34038751,-133,"Bisphenol S, bisphenol A",Reproductive,Gonadal sex steroid hormone secretion after exposure of male rats to estrogenic chemicals and their combinations.,"Environmental chemicals can interfere with the endocrine axis hence they are classified as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Bisphenol S (BPS) is used in the manufacture of consumer products because of its superior thermal stability and is thought to be a safe replacement chemical for its analog bisphenol A (BPA). However, the safety profile of these compounds alone or in the presence of other EDCs is yet to be fully investigated. Also, the estrogenic chemical 17Œ±-ethinyl estradiol (EE2) and a constituent of female oral contraceptives for women, is present in water supplies. To simulate concurrent exposure of the population to chemical mixtures, we investigated the effects of BPA, BPS, EE2, and their combinations on sex steroid secretion in the growing male rat gonad. Prepubertal and pubertal male rats at 21 and 35 days of age were provided test chemicals in drinking water (parts per billion) for 14 days. At termination of exposure, some individual chemical effects were modified by exposure to chemical combinations. Single chemical exposures markedly decreased androgen secretion but their combination (e.g., BPA¬†+¬†BPS¬†+¬†EE2) caused the opposite effect, i.e., increased Leydig cell T secretion. Also, the test chemicals acting alone or in combination increased testicular and Leydig cell 17Œ≤-estradiol (E2) secretion. Chemical-induced changes in T and E2 secretion were associated with altered testicular expression of the cholesterol side-chain cleavage (Cyp11a1) and 17Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (Hsd17Œ≤) enzyme protein. Additional studies are warranted to understand the mechanisms by which single and chemical combinations impact function of testicular cells and disrupt their paracrine regulation.","Androgens,Benzhydryl Compounds,Drinking Water,Endocrine Disruptors,Phenols,Sulfones,Water Pollutants, Chemical,Ethinyl Estradiol,Estradiol,bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)sulfone,17-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases,Cholesterol Side-Chain Cleavage Enzyme,bisphenol A",,"Age Factors,Breast Feeding,Female,Gestational Age,Humans,Hypertension,Infant Food,Infant, Newborn,Infant, Premature,Longitudinal Studies,Male,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Complications,Prolactin,Reference Values,Sex Factors"
31501865,-133,"Bisphenol A, Bisphenol S",Skeletal,Gestational Exposure to Bisphenol A and Bisphenol S Leads to Fetal Skeletal Muscle Hypertrophy Independent of Sex.,"Gestational exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) can lead to offspring insulin resistance. However, despite the role that the skeletal muscle plays in glucose homeostasis, it remains unknown whether gestational exposure to BPA, or its analog bisphenol S (BPS), impairs skeletal muscle development. We hypothesized that gestational exposure to BPA or BPS will impair fetal muscle development and lead to muscle-specific insulin resistance. To test this, pregnant sheep (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ7-8/group) were exposed to BPA or BPS from gestational day (GD) 30 to 100. At GD120, fetal skeletal muscle was harvested to evaluate fiber size, fiber type, and gene and protein expression related to myogenesis, fiber size, fiber type, and inflammation. Fetal primary myoblasts were isolated to evaluate proliferation and differentiation. In fetal skeletal muscle, myofibers were larger in BPA and BPS groups in both females and males. BPA females had higher MYH1 (reflective of type-IIX fast glycolytic fibers), whereas BPS females had higher MYH2 and MYH7, and higher myogenic regulatory factors (Myf5, MyoG, MyoD, and MRF4) mRNA expression. No differences were observed in males. Myoblast proliferation was not altered in gestationally BPA- or BPS-exposed myoblasts, but upon differentiation, area and diameter of myotubes were larger independent of sex. Females had larger myofibers and myotubes than males in all treatment groups. In conclusion, gestational exposure to BPA or BPS does not result in insulin resistance in fetal myoblasts but leads to fetal fiber hypertrophy in skeletal muscle independent of sex and alters fiber type distribution in a sex-specific manner.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Phenols,Sulfones,bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)sulfone,bisphenol A","Behavior,Children,Cognition,Phthalate exposure,Pregnancy","Age Factors,Child,Child Behavior,Child Development,Child, Preschool,Cognition,Endocrine Disruptors,Female,Gestational Age,Humans,Infant,Infant Behavior,Infant, Newborn,Male,Nervous System,Neurotoxicity Syndromes,Phthalic Acids,Pregnancy,Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects,Psychomotor Performance,Risk Assessment,Risk Factors,Sex Factors"
35355194,-133,Nonylphenol,Neurological,Thymoquinone Improved Nonylphenol-Induced Memory Deficit and Neurotoxicity Through Its Antioxidant and Neuroprotective Effects.,"Nonylphenol (NP), a well-known endocrine-disrupter chemical, has several harmful effects on the central nervous system including neuroendocrine disruption, cognitive impairment, and neurotoxicity. Thymoquinone (TQ) is a main bioactive compound in the black seeds of Nigella sativa that has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties. Here, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of TQ against NP-induced memory deficit and neurotoxicity in rats. To induce memory impairment, NP (25¬†mg/kg) was used as gavage in male Wistar rats for 21¬†days. TQ (2.5, 5, and 10¬†mg/kg) was intraperitoneally administered in NP-treated animals. The morris water maze test was performed to assess spatial learning and memory. The hippocampal tissues were isolated from the brain for histopathological evaluation. Biochemical, molecular, and cellular tests were performed to quantify oxidant (malondialdehyde; MDA)/antioxidant (superoxide dismutase (SOD), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and reduced glutathione (GSH) parameters) as well as markers for astrocytic activation (glial fibrillary acidic protein; GFAP) and neuronal death (alpha-synuclein; Œ±-syn). Results showed TQ (5¬†mg/kg) significantly improved NP-induced memory impairment. Histological data revealed a significant increase in the number of necrotic cells in hippocampus, and TQ treatment markedly decreased this effect. The GSH and TAC levels were significantly increased in TQ-treated groups compared to NP group. The molecular analysis indicated that NP increased GFAP and decreased Œ±-syn expression and TQ treatment did the reverse. In vitro study in astrocytes isolated from mice brain showed that TQ significantly increased cell viability in NP-induced cytotoxicity. This study strongly indicates that TQ has neuroprotective effects on NP-induced neurotoxicity through reducing oxidative damages and neuroinflammation. This study investigates the behavioral neurotoxicity induced by Nonylphenol (NP) and the protective effects of Thymoquinone (TQ) as a potent antioxidant compound using molecular, cell culture, histopathological and biochemical techniques.","Antioxidants,Benzoquinones,Neuroprotective Agents,Phenols,nonylphenol,thymoquinone","Hyperthyroidism,ICM,Iodinated contrast media,Iodine-induced,Tachycardia","Aged, 80 and over,Contrast Media,Fatal Outcome,Female,Heart Failure,Humans,Hyperthyroidism,Radiography, Thoracic,Tachycardia,Tomography, X-Ray Computed"
34018699,-133,Aroclor 1221,Genetic,Effects of endocrine-disrupting chemicals on hypothalamic oxytocin and vasopressin systems.,"Exposures to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) perturb hormonal systems. EDCs are particularly problematic when exposure happens in the fetus and infant due to the high sensitivity of developing organisms to hormone actions. Previous work has shown that prenatal polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposure disrupts hypothalamic development, reproductive physiology, mate preference behavior, and social behaviors in a sexually dimorphic manner. Based on evidence that EDCs perturb social behaviors in rodents, we examined effects of PCBs on the neuropeptides oxytocin (OXT) and vasopressin (AVP) that are involved in regulating these behaviors. Rats were exposed prenatally (gestational days 16 and 18) to the weakly estrogenic PCB mixture Aroclor 1221 (0.5 or 1‚Äâmg/kg), to estradiol benzoate (EB, a positive control), or to the vehicle (3% dimethyl sulfoxide). In adult (~P90) brains, we counted immunolabeled oxytocin and vasopressin cell numbers in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (SON) of the hypothalamus. EDCs did not change absolute numbers of oxytocin or vasopressin cells in either region, although there were some modest shifts in the rostral-caudal distribution. Second, expression of genes for these nonapeptides (Oxt, Avp), their receptors (Oxtr, Avpr1a), and the estrogen receptor beta (Esr2), was determined by qPCR. In the PVN, there were dose-dependent effects of PCBs in males (Oxt, Oxtr), and effects of EB in females (Avp, Esr2). In the SON, Oxt, and Esr2 were affected by treatments in males. These changes to protein and gene expression caused by prenatal treatments suggest that transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms play roles in mediating how EDCs reprogram hypothalamic development.","Endocrine Disruptors,Vasopressins,Oxytocin",,"Aged,Alzheimer Disease,Fatty Acids,Glucagon,Humans,Hyperglycemia,Hyperinsulinism,Lactates,Memory,Norepinephrine,Psychiatric Status Rating Scales"
34929351,-133,Bisphenol A,Skeletal,Bisphenol A induces pyroptotic cell death via ROS/NLRP3/Caspase-1 pathway in osteocytes MLO-Y4.,"Bisphenol A (BPA), a ubiquitous endocrine-disrupting chemical, is commonly used as a plasticizer to manufacture various food packaging materials. Evidence has demonstrated that BPA disturbed bone health. However, few studies focused on the effect of BPA on osteocytes, making up over 95% of all the bone cells. Here, we reported that BPA inhibited the cell viability of MLO-Y4 cells, and increased apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, BPA up-regulated protein expressions of speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC), NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1 (Casp-1 p20) and cleaved gasdermin D (GSDMD-N), and increased the ratios of interleukin (IL)-1Œ≤/pro-IL-1Œ≤ and IL-18/pro-IL-18 in MLO-Y4 cells. BPA enhanced levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), IL-1Œ≤ and IL-18 in culture supernatants. This pyroptotic death and the NLPR3 inflammasome activation were reversed by the caspase-1 inhibitor VX765 or the NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor MCC950. Furthermore, BPA stimulated the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial ROS (mtROS), elevated malondialdehyde (MDA) level and decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, which led to oxidative damage in MLO-Y4 cells. The ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or the mitochondrial antioxidant Mito-TEMPO inhibited the NLPR3 inflammasome activation and pyroptotic death induced by BPA. Collectively, our data suggest that BPA causes pyroptotic death of osteocytes via ROS/NLRP3/Caspase-1 pathway.","Benzhydryl Compounds,NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein,Nlrp3 protein, mouse,Phenols,Reactive Oxygen Species,Casp1 protein, mouse,Caspase 1,bisphenol A","Age at menarche,Arsenic,Bangladesh,Cohort study,Drinking water,Prenatal exposure","Aged,Arsenic,Bangladesh,Cohort Studies,Environmental Exposure,Female,Humans,Infant,Menarche,Pregnancy,Prospective Studies"

Characterization of the primary fibroblast was via morphology, genetics, immunocytochemistry, and stable culture conditions for optimal toxicity screening. Cell viability assays-MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-were performed to observe cytotoxicity, and quantitative PCR was conducted to confirm gene alteration by EP exposure.

DEHP is an endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) that has been shown to disrupt the function of reproductive system in females. Although many studies have shown that DEHP potentially causes female reproductive toxicity, including depletion of the primordial follicle and decreased sex hormone production, the specific mechanisms by which DEHP affects female reproduction remain unknown. In recent years, research focused on the intestinal flora has provided an idea to eliminate our confusion, and gut bacterial dysbiosis may contribute to female reproductive toxicity. In the present study, the feces of DEHP-exposed mice were collected and analyzed using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and untargeted global metabolite profiling of metabolomics. DEHP obviously causes reproductive toxicity, including the ovarian organ coefficient, estradiol level, histological features of the ovary and estrus. Furthermore, DEHP exposure alters the structure of the intestinal microbiota community and fecal metabolite profile in mice, suggesting that the reproductive toxicity may be caused by gut bacterial dysbiosis and altered metabolites, such as changes in the levels of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA). Additionally, it is well known that changes in gut microbiota and fecal metabolites cause inflammation and tissue oxidative stress, expectedly, we found oxidative stress in the ovary and systemic inflammation in DEHP exposed mice. Thus, based on our findings, DEHP exposure may cause gut bacterial dysbiosis and altered metabolite profiles, particularly SCFA profiles, leading to oxidative stress in the ovary and systemic inflammation to ultimately induce female reproductive toxicity.","Phthalic Acids,RNA, Ribosomal, 16S,phthalic acid,Diethylhexyl Phthalate",,"Aggression,Animals,Biogenic Amines,Female,Humans,Macaca mulatta,Maternal Behavior,Models, Psychological,Motivation,Object Attachment,Social Behavior,Social Isolation"

However, different results indicate that DBP plays an accelerated, delayed, or neutral role in the initiation of puberty. Furthermore, whether the effect of DBP on puberty will disrupt the function of reproductive system in the adults is still ambiguous. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effect of maternal exposure to DBP on the onset of puberty in male offspring mice and the subsequent changes in the development of reproductive system. Here, pregnant mice were treated with 0 (control), 50, 250, or 500 mg/kg/day DBP in 1 mL/kg corn oil administered daily by oral gavage from gestation day (GD) 12.5 to parturition. Compared with the control group, the 50 mg/kg/day DBP group accelerated puberty onset and testicular development were quite remarkable in male offspring mice during early puberty. Furthermore, in 22-day male offspring mice, 50 mg/kg/day DBP induced increased levels of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and testosterone in serum, and promoted the expression of steroidogenesis-related genes in the testes.

In adulthood, testes of the male offspring mice exposed to all doses of DBP exhibited adverse morphology compared with the control group. These results demonstrated that maternal exposure to 50 mg/kg/day DBP induced earlier puberty and precocious development of the testis, and eventually damaged the reproductive system in the later life.","Endocrine Disruptors,Gonadal Steroid Hormones,Phthalic Acids,Steroids,Dibutyl Phthalate,monobutyl phthalate",,"Aging,Animals,Antioxidants,Arrhythmias, Cardiac,Heart,Humans,Melatonin,Oxidative Stress"

Growing epidemiological evidence suggests that PBDEs alter cardiovascular function. The goal of this study was to examine the effects of BDE-47 on adrenal corticosteroid pathways that play vital roles in cardiovascular homeostasis and pathophysiology. The effect of BDE-47 on aldosterone and cortisol secretion was characterized in a human adrenocortical cell line. HAC15 cells were exposed to various concentrations of BDE-47 (1 nM to 100 ŒºM). Cell viability, corticosteroid secretion, gene expression of enzymes involved in corticosteroid synthesis, and metabolic activity was examined. Additionally, Sprague Dawley male rats were orally exposed to BDE-47 (10 or 100 ¬µg/kg), 5 days per week for 16 weeks. Organ weights and plasma corticosteroid levels were measured. In HAC15 cells, basal and stimulated aldosterone and cortisol secretion was significantly increased by BDE-47. Gene expression of several enzymes involved in corticosteroid synthesis and mitochondrial metabolism also increased. In Sprague Dawley rats, adrenal but not heart, kidney, or liver weights, were significantly increased in BDE-47 treatment groups. Plasma corticosterone levels were significantly increased in the 100 ¬µg BDE-47/kg treatment group. No change in plasma aldosterone levels were observed with BDE-47 exposure. These data indicate that BDE-47 disrupts the regulation of corticosteroid secretion and provides further evidence that PBDEs are potential endocrine disruptors. Future studies will determine the underlying molecular mechanism of altered corticosteroid production and examine whether these alterations result in underlying cardiovascular disease in our rodent model of 16-week BDE-47 exposure.","Adrenal Cortex Hormones,Endocrine Disruptors,Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers,2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether",,"Aging,Animals,Circadian Rhythm,Humans,Immune System,Neurosecretory Systems"

The typical EDC 4-nonylphenol (4-NP) has been identified as an obesogen. However, the in vitro effects of 4-NP on adipogenesis remain unclear. In this study, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and C3H/10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were used to investigate the influence of 4-NP on adipogenesis. The differentiation protocols for 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and C3H/10T1/2 MSCs took 8 and 12‚Äâdays, respectively, beginning at Day 0. In differentiated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, 20‚ÄâŒºM 4-NP decreased cell viability on Days 4 and 8. Exposure to 4-NP inhibited triglyceride (TG) accumulation and adipogenic marker expression on Days 0-8, but the inhibitory effects were weaker on Days 2-8. The protein expression of pSTAT3 or STAT3 decreased on Days 0-8 and 2-8. Conversely, 4-NP promoted TG accumulation and the adipogenic marker expression in C3H/10T1/2 adipocytes. The opposing effects were attributed to physiological differences between the two cell lines. The 3T3-L1 preadipocytes are dependent on mitotic clonal expansion (MCE) to drive differentiation, while C3H/10T1/2MSCs and human preadipocytes are not. Additionally, 4-NP downregulated Œ≤-catenin expression in C3H/10T1/2 adipocytes. Accordingly, we hypothesized that 4-NP promotes adipogenesis. The role of the canonical Wnt pathway in the promotion of adipogenesis by 4-NP requires further validation. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms and appropriate risk management of 4-NP.","Phenols,4-nonylphenol","Adult exposure,Endocrine-disrupting chemicals,Female health,Ovarian aging,Ovarian reserve","Aging,Animals,Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Exposure,Female,Ovarian Reserve,Ovary,Polychlorinated Biphenyls"

However, the molecular mechanisms directly linking the actions of PCBs and OH-PCBs on the AR and ER to induce reproductive impairment remain poorly understood. In this study, we characterized the cellular response to PCBs and OH-PCBs acting on AR and ER transactivation at the transcriptome level coupled with bioinformatics analysis to identify the downstream pathways of androgen and estrogen signaling that leads to reproductive dysfunction. We first confirmed the agonistic and antagonistic effects of several PCBs and OH-PCBs on AR- and ER-mediated reporter gene activity using the androgen-responsive LNCaP and estrogen-responsive MCF-7 cell lines, respectively. Anti-estrogenic activity was not detected among the tested compounds; however, we found that in addition to anti-androgenic and estrogenic activity, PCB 28 and PCB 138 exhibited androgenic activity, while most of the tested OH-PCBs showed a synergistic effect on DHT-mediated transactivation of the AR. Bioinformatics analysis of transcriptome profiles from selected PCBs and OH-PCBs revealed various pathways that were dysregulated depending on their agonistic, antagonistic, or synergistic effects. The OH-PCBs with estrogenic activity affected pathways including vitamin metabolism and calcium transport. Other notable dysregulated pathways include cholesterol transport in response to androgenic PCBs, thyroid hormone metabolism in response to anti-androgenic PCBs, and antioxidant pathways in response to androgen-synergistic OH-PCBs. Our results demonstrate that PCBs and OH-PCBs directly alter specific pathways through androgen- or estrogen-mediated signaling, thereby providing additional insights into the mechanisms by which these compounds cause reproductive dysfunction.","AR protein, human,Estrogens,Receptors, Androgen,Receptors, Estrogen,Polychlorinated Biphenyls",,"Aging,Animals,Energy Metabolism,Humans,Kynurenine,Mental Disorders,NAD,Neurodegenerative Diseases,Signal Transduction,Tryptophan"

TCS is also considered as an underlying endocrine disruptor and has anti-androgenic effects. In our previous work, we found that TCS suppressed testicular steroidogenesis via the miR-6321/JNK/Nur77 cascade, but roles of the abnormal expression of miR-142-5p and P450c17 in this molecular event were still unknown. Therefore, to verify the hypothesis that miR-142-5p and P450c17 might significantly function in other manner in testosterone decline after TCS exposure, Sprague-Dawley rats and the rat Leydig cell line were used in this study. Results showed that after TCS exposure, testicular histomorphology was abnormally changed and testosterone level was declined. Overexpressed miR-142-5p by TCS directly targeted the JAK1/STAT1 pathway. Bidirectional Co-IP assays and the use of STAT1 activator demonstrated that STAT1 could interact with and regulate Sp1. The activity, mRNA level, and protein expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3Œ≤ were all decreased after TCS treatment. Sp1 silencing, ChIP, and qPCR assays showed that Sp1 regulated DNMT1 expressions by directly binding to the promoter region of DNMT1. Though the DNA methylation status of the DAX1 promoter was not affected, TCS induced the transcription and translation of DAX1 by DNMT1, in turn leading to the inhibition of steroidogenic P450c17. Taken together, TCS-induced miR-142-5p inhibits P450c17 by the JAK1/STAT1 pathway and downstream Sp1/DNMT1/DAX1 cascade, finally facilitating the decrease in testosterone levels.","DAX-1 Orphan Nuclear Receptor,MIRN142 microRNA, rat,MicroRNAs,Testosterone,Triclosan,Steroid 17-alpha-Hydroxylase",,"Aging,Animals,Humans,Immune System,Melatonin,Neurosecretory Systems,Thymus Gland,Zinc"

Recent studies have shown an association between decreased spermatogenesis and gut microbiota alteration. However, the potential associations and mechanisms of BPA exposure on spermatogenesis, hormone production, and gut microbiota remain unknown. This study aims to investigate BPA-induced male reproductive toxicity and the potential link with gut microbiota dysbiosis. Male Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to BPA at different doses by oral gavage for thirty consecutive days. The extent of testicular damage was evaluated by basic parameters of body weight and hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. Next, we determined the mRNA levels and protein levels of apoptosis, histone-related factors, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in testes. Finally, 16¬†S rDNA sequencing was used to analyze gut microbiota composition after BPA exposure. BPA exposure damaged testicular histology, significantly decreased sperm count, and increased sperm abnormalities. In addition, BPA exposure caused oxidative stress and cell apoptosis in testes. The levels of histone (H2A, H3) were significantly increased, while ubiquitin histone H2A (ub-H2A) and ubiquitin histone H2B (ub-H2B) were markedly reduced. Furthermore, BPA activated the PI3K and AKT expression, but the protein expressions of mTOR and 4EBP1 in testes were inhibited significantly. Additionally, the relative abundance of class Gammaproteobacteria, and order Betaproteobacteriales was significantly higher when treated with a high dose of BPA compared to the control group, which was negatively correlated with testosterone level.

Corn oil containing DMSO was used as vehicle control. Serum and kidney tissues were collected for study. Biomarkers associated with kidney function, oxidative stress, inflammation and fibrosis were assessed. Our results showed that TCS could cause renal injury as was revealed by increased levels of renal function markers including serum creatinine, urea nitrogen and uric acid, as well as increased oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory cytokines and fibrotic markers in a dose dependent manner, which were more significantly in 100 mg/(kg‚Ä¢day) group. Mass spectrometry-based analysis of metabolites related with lipid metabolism demonstrated the occurrence of lipid accumulation and defective fatty acid oxidation in 100 mg/(kg‚Ä¢day) TCS-exposed mouse kidney. These processes might lead to lipotoxicity and energy depletion, thus resulting in kidney fibrosis and functional decline. Taken together, the present study demonstrated that TCS could induce lipid accumulation and fatty acid metabolism disturbance in mouse kidney, which might contribute to renal function impairment. The present study further widens our insights into the adverse effects of TCS.","Anti-Infective Agents,Cytokines,Fatty Acids,Uric Acid,Triclosan,Corn Oil,Urea,Creatinine,Nitrogen,Dimethyl Sulfoxide","agriculture,endocrine disruption,livestock farming,manure,steroid hormones","Agriculture,Animals,Cattle,Environmental Monitoring,Estrogens,Manure,Soil Pollutants,Swine"

32497202,-131,4-nonylphenol,Reproductive,"A prominent environmental endocrine disruptor, 4-nonylphenol, promotes endometriosis development via plasmacytoid dendritic cells.","Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent chronic inflammatory disease and is associated etiologically with environmental endocrine disruptor (EED) exposure. 4-nonylphenol (NP), a widely found EED, has weak estrogenic activity and modulates plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) function in vitro and in vivo. We aimed to elucidate the immunomodulatory effect of NP on the development of endometriosis, particularly focusing on pDCs. This study established a surgically induced endometriosis murine model (C57BL/6) under conditions of NP treatment that are relevant to the level and route of human exposure. Multi-parametric flow cytometry was used for analysis of infiltrated immune cell subsets in lesions. The results showed that NP exposure significantly promoted endometriotic lesion growth, survival and angiogenesis development of lesions as well as pDC accumulation in the lesions in mice. Adoptive transfer of NP-conditioned pDCs into mice significantly enhanced lesion development and local pDC infiltration, whereas NP-conditioned conventional dendritic cells did not affect lesion growth. In vitro functional analysis showed that NP-conditioned pDCs in lesions expressed high levels of CD36, a scavenger receptor and NP-conditioned splenic pDCs secreted an enhanced level of IL-10 in response to apoptotic cell recognition in a CD36-dependent manner. Furthermore, we observed that local treatment with blocking antibodies against IL-10 and CD36 on the day of surgery significantly inhibited lesion development. NP exposure also altered the estrous cycle in mice. The results suggest that chronic and low-dose exposure to NP enhances endometriotic lesion growth by altering pDC homeostasis and function. This study has important implications for understanding the environment-innate immunity interaction in human endometriosis.","CD36 Antigens,Endocrine Disruptors,Phenols,Interleukin-10,4-nonylphenol","Air pollution,Bone damage,Fractures,Mechanisms,Osteoporosis,Particulate matter","Air Pollutants,Air Pollution,Particulate Matter,Quality of Life,Smoking"

Despite efforts for its early detection, its worldwide incidence continues to increase. Thus, identification of risk factors for its development and new targets for its therapy are of vital importance. Environmental pollutants derived from human activity have been associated with predisposition to the development of cancer. Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine disruptor compound (EDC) widely used in the manufacture of polycarbonates, and it has affinity for the estrogen receptor (ER). Scientific evidence has proposed an association between increased incidence of breast cancer and BPA exposure at lower doses. Among worldwide concerns with BPA exposure, different industries proceeded to replace BPA with analogs such as bisphenol S (BPS), which is now employed in products labelled as BPA-free. Nevertheless, recent studies exhibit that its exposure results in altered mammary gland development and morphogenesis; and promotes breast cancer cell proliferation. Of note, most of the effects of both BPA and BPS have been performed in estrogen-dependent breast cancer models. However, gaps in knowledge still exist on the roles and mechanisms that both compounds, specifically BPS, may play in cancer initiation and development in hormone-dependent and other types of breast cancer. Thus, the aim of the present study was to deepen the understanding of biological targets modulated by these ubiquitous pollutants in different breast cancer cell lines, representing two scenarios of this pathology: hormone-dependent and hormone-independent breast cancer. Results point out that both compounds induced proliferation in ER positive cells, not showing this effect in the ER-negative breast cancer cells. Different targets modified at the proteomic level in both breast cancer scenarios were also identified. Stem cell markers (eg. CD44) and invasion proteins (eg. MMP-14) were importantly increased by BPA and BPS in ER-positive breast cancer cells. In contrast, growth factors and associated receptors such as EGFR and TGF-Œ≤ were induced by BPS in the ER-negative breast cancer cells; both pollutants induced an increase of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein secretion. This finding suggests that the use of BPS must be considered with more caution than BPA, since it can act independently of the presence of the hormonal receptor. These findings show new evidence that BPA and BPS exposure can contribute to breast cancer development and progression. Our results suggest that both BPA and BPS must be considered equally as outstanding risk factors for this pathology.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Environmental Pollutants,Phenols,Sulfones,Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A,bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)sulfone,bisphenol A","Air pollution,EDC,Endocrine disruptors,Gut-lung axis,Immune system,Metabolic dysfunction,Microbiome dysbiosis","Air Pollution,Dysbiosis,Endocrine Disruptors,Female,Gastrointestinal Microbiome,Humans,Microbiota"

Thus, the aim of the present study was to deepen the understanding of biological targets modulated by these ubiquitous pollutants in different breast cancer cell lines, representing two scenarios of this pathology: hormone-dependent and hormone-independent breast cancer. Results point out that both compounds induced proliferation in ER positive cells, not showing this effect in the ER-negative breast cancer cells. Different targets modified at the proteomic level in both breast cancer scenarios were also identified. Stem cell markers (eg. CD44) and invasion proteins (eg. MMP-14) were importantly increased by BPA and BPS in ER-positive breast cancer cells. In contrast, growth factors and associated receptors such as EGFR and TGF-Œ≤ were induced by BPS in the ER-negative breast cancer cells; both pollutants induced an increase of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein secretion. This finding suggests that the use of BPS must be considered with more caution than BPA, since it can act independently of the presence of the hormonal receptor. These findings show new evidence that BPA and BPS exposure can contribute to breast cancer development and progression. Our results suggest that both BPA and BPS must be considered equally as outstanding risk factors for this pathology.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Environmental Pollutants,Phenols,Sulfones,Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A,bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)sulfone,bisphenol A","Air pollution,EDC,Endocrine disruptors,Gut-lung axis,Immune system,Metabolic dysfunction,Microbiome dysbiosis","Air Pollution,Dysbiosis,Endocrine Disruptors,Female,Gastrointestinal Microbiome,Humans,Microbiota"

Here, we further investigated the malign influence of Fen on the migration and angiogenesis via regulation of the estrogen receptor (ER) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways in breast cancer models. ER-positive MCF-7 and ER-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were exposed to 17Œ≤-estradiol (E2, 10\xa0M), Fen (10\xa0M and 10\xa0M), ICI 182,780 (ICI; an ER antagonist, 10\xa0M) or/and Pictilisib (Pic; a PI3K inhibitor, 10\xa0M), and subsequently subjected to migration assay, live cell motility monitoring, trans-chamber assay, immunofluorescence, angiogenesis assay, tumor spheroid formation, and Western blot analysis. In MCF-7 cells, E2 and Fen induced cell migration by regulating the cell migration-related proteins. Although expressions of N-cadherin and Vimentin remained unchanged E2 and Fen induced the decrease of E-cadherin and Occludin in the immunofluorescence assay and Western blot analysis. In addition, Fen increased vessel formation in HUVEC cells. Furthermore, Fen treatment induced the formation of larger and denser tumor spheroids in MCF-7 cells. Western blot further confirmed the increased expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and sex-determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2) after exposure to Fen. We conclude that Fen plays an important role as an endocrine-disrupting chemical in breast cancer migration and metastasis through the regulation of ER and PI3K signaling pathways.'}","Amides,Fungicides, Industrial,Receptors, Estrogen,Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A,Estradiol,N-(2,3-dichloro-4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-methylcyclohexanecarboxamide","Xenopus laevis,multiwell plate,screening assay,thibz gene,thyroid hormone","Alanine,Animals,Endocrine Disruptors,Gene Expression,Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers,High-Throughput Screening Assays,Signal Transduction,Thyroid Hormones,Triiodothyronine,Xenopus laevis"

Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) was used at a high dose level (750 mg/kg bw/day) as an established positive control substance for anti-androgenic effects on the developing male reproductive tract. We focussed on the MPW and measured a multitude of biological endpoints at various life stages and applied state of the art histopathology staining techniques to refine the characterization of potential changes to the testis, beyond what is currently available with DINP. If DINP can mediate testicular dysgenesis (TDS) disorders, this exposure window would be sufficient to induce androgen impacts and alter male reproductive tract development as shown earlier in this validated experimental model with DBP. Overall, the results of this systematic comparison provide convincing evidence on the differences between the effects occurring with DBP and DINP. In contrast to what was seen with DBP, DINP did not cause cryptorchidism or hypospadias, had no effect on anogenital distance/anogenital index (AGD/AGi) and Leydig cell aggregates on e17.5 and e21.5 did not increase. With DINP no reduction of intratesticular testosterone, no effects on sperm motility and sperm count and no effect on adult testosterone or luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were seen.

36220427,-130,di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate,Reproductive,H3K4me3 as a target of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) impairing primordial follicle assembly.,"Di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a widely used plastics additive that growing evidence indicates as endocrine disruptor able to negatively affect various reproductive processes both in female and male animals, including humans. However, the precise molecular mechanism of such actions is not completely understood. In the present study, scRNA-seq was performed on the ovaries of offspring from mothers exposed to DEHP from 16.5 days post coitum to 3 days post-partum, when the primordial follicle (PF) stockpile is established. While the histological observations of the offspring ovaries from DEHP exposed mothers confirmed previous data about a distinct reduction of oocytes enclosed in PFs. Focusing on oocytes, scRNA-seq analyses showed that the genes that mostly changed by DEHP were enriched GO terms related to histone H3-K4 methylation. Moreover, we observed H3K4me3 level, an epigenetics modification of H3 that is crucial for chromatin transcription, decreased by 40.28% (P¬†<¬†0.01) in DEHP-treated group compared with control. When the newborn ovaries were cultured in vitro, the DEHP effects were abolished by tamoxifen (an estrogen receptor antagonist) or overexpression of Smyd3 (one specific methyltransferase of H3K4me3), in particular, the percentage of oocyte enclosed in PF was increased by 15.39% in DEHP plus Smyd3 overexpression group than of DEHP group (P¬†<¬†0.01), which was accompanied by the upregulation of H3K4me3. Collectively, the present results discover Smyd3-H3K4me3 as a novel target of the deleterious ER-mediated effect of DEHP on PF formation during early folliculogenesis in the mouse and highlight epigenetics changes as prominent targets of endocrine disruptors like DEHP.","Diethylhexyl Phthalate,Endocrine Disruptors,histone H3 trimethyl Lys4,Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase,Histones,phthalic acid,SMYD3 protein, human","High-fat diet,alcohol,alcohol use disorder,homeostatic,neuroendocrine,nutritional contingency,palatable diet.","Alcohol Drinking,Appetite,Binge-Eating Disorder,Eating,Feeding Behavior,Feeding and Eating Disorders,Humans"
36142703,-130,Bisphenol S,Allergies,Effects of Oral Exposure to Low-Dose Bisphenol S on Allergic Asthma in Mice.,"Bisphenol S (BPS) is increasingly being used as an alternative for bisphenol A; however, its health effects remain unclear. We investigated the effects of oral exposure to low-dose BPS on allergic asthma. C3H/HeJ male mice were intratracheally administered with allergen (ovalbumin (OVA), 1 Œºg/animal) every 2 weeks from 6 to 11 weeks old. BPS was ingested by drinking water at doses equivalent to 0.04, 0.4, and 4 Œºg/kg/day. We then examined pulmonary inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, serum OVA-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) levels, Th2 cytokine/chemokine production, and mediastinal lymph node (MLN) cell activities. Compared with OVA alone, moderate-dose BPS (BPS-M) with OVA significantly enhanced pulmonary inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, and OVA-specific IgE and IgG1. Furthermore, interleukin (IL)-5, IL-13, IL-33, and CCL11/Eotaxin protein levels in the lungs increased. Conversely, these allergic responses were reduced in the high-dose BPS+OVA group. In MLN cells, BPS-M with OVA increased the total cell count and activated antigen-presenting cells including conventional dendritic cell subset (cDC2). After OVA restimulation, cell proliferation and Th2 cytokine production (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) in the culture supernatant also increased. Therefore, oral exposure to low-dose BPS may exacerbate allergic asthmatic responses by enhancing Th2-polarized responses and activating the MLN cells.","Allergens,Cytokines,Drinking Water,Immunoglobulin G,Interleukin-13,Interleukin-33,Interleukin-5,Phenols,Sulfones,Interleukin-4,Immunoglobulin E,bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)sulfone,Ovalbumin",,"Alcohol Oxidoreductases,Animals,Blood Glucose,Body Weight,Cell Differentiation,Congenital Abnormalities,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Insulin-Secreting Cells,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Organogenesis,Pancreas,Paracrine Communication,Tretinoin"

Cd, DBP, and Cd\xa0+\xa0DBP lowered serum testosterone levels in male fetuses. Cd and DBP did not alter fetal Leydig cell (FLC) number, but the combined exposure led to decreased FLC number. Cd did not affect FLC aggregation while DBP caused FLC aggregation and the combined exposure worsened FLC aggregation. Cd lowered FLC mRNA (Lhcgr, Star, Cyp11a1, and Insl3) levels and DBP lowered Lhcgr, Star, Insl3, and Nr5a1 levels. DBP up-regulated Scarb1 expression without affecting Cyp11a1 while the combined exposure antagonized DBP.

32497815,-130,Cadmium,Reproductive,Cadmium exposure during prenatal development causes progesterone disruptors in multiple generations via steroidogenic enzymes in rat ovarian granulosa cells.,"Exposure to the heavy metal cadmium (Cd) in the environment is linked to adverse health. To fully understand the adverse effects of this important endocrine-disrupting compound (EDC) requires studies that address multigenerational effects and epigenetic mechanisms. The present study orally dosed pregnant SD rats with Cd from gestation day 1 until birth. First filial generation (F1) female rats were mated with untreated males to generate the secondary filial generation (F2). Ovarian granulosa cells (OGCs) were collected at postnatal day (PND) 56 from both generations after prenatal Cd exposure, and hormone secretion examinations showed a progesterone disorder. Significant decreases in steroidogenic enzymes (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and P450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (CYP11A1)) were observed in F1 and F2 rats. However, F1 and F2 rats had different patterns of mRNA and protein expression of steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1). We also found that microRNAs were significantly changed using a microarray, and miR-10b-5p and miR-27a-3p were upregulated in F1 and F2 rats. The COV434¬†cell line microRNA-knockdown model showed that these two important microRNAs regulated the StAR-induced Cd effect on progesterone secretion. Overall, the results of this study indicate that prenatal Cd exposure causes cytotoxicity problems, progesterone disorder and microRNAs expression changed in a multigenerational manner. And progesterone disorder may interfere with the steroidogenic enzymes in offspring. The present study also revealed that environmental pollution produces multigenerational effects.","Endocrine Disruptors,MicroRNAs,Phosphoproteins,RNA, Messenger,steroidogenic acute regulatory protein,Cadmium,Progesterone,Cholesterol Side-Chain Cleavage Enzyme","PFOA,endocrine disrupting chemicals,hormone-dependent cancers","Aldrin,Breast Neoplasms,Endocrine Disruptors,Hormones,Humans,Male,Obesity,Prostate"
18977275,-130,Fipronil,Thyroid,Fipronil-induced disruption of thyroid function in rats is mediated by increased total and free thyroxine clearances concomitantly to increased activity of hepatic enzymes.,"Fipronil is a widely used phytosanitary product and insecticide for pets. In the rat, fipronil can disrupt thyroid function by decreasing plasma concentrations of total thyroxine (T4) likely through increased T4 clearance. However, the mechanism of fipronil action on thyroid function remains unclear. The goals of the present study were to evaluate the effects of fipronil on thyroid hormone (TH) concentrations and elimination in the rat under well characterized plasma exposure to fipronil and its main metabolite fipronil sulfone. In thyroid-intact female rats, fipronil treatment (3 mg/(kg day) per os for 14 days) decreased both total and free TH plasma concentrations concomitantly to increased thyroid stimulating hormone plasma concentrations. A T4-free euthyroid-like model consisting of thyroidectomized rats treated with tri-iodothyronine (12 microg/(kg day), sc) was developed to evaluate both total and free T4 clearances. In this model, fipronil treatment induced a twofold increase in total and free T4 clearances. The same fipronil treatment increased antipyrine clearance in thyroid-intact rats suggesting an increase in the activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes. Finally, this treatment was also associated with an increase in hepatic microsomal 4-nitrophenol UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity involved in T4 glucuronidation. Thus, fipronil-induced thyroid disruption results from an increased rate of T4 elimination likely mediated by increased hepatic enzyme activity. Plasma concentrations of fipronil sulfone were at least 20-fold higher than those of fipronil. This highlights the need to further investigate the contribution of fipronil sulfone to the fipronil-induced thyroid disruption.","Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal,Endocrine Disruptors,Insecticides,Pyrazoles,Thyroid Hormones,Thyrotropin,Glucuronosyltransferase,Thyroxine,fipronil,Antipyrine","Cloning,Expression profiles,Green algae,HOP,Heat shock protein,Stress response","Algal Proteins,Cloning, Molecular,Closterium,Disinfectants,Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Pollutants,Fresh Water,HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins,HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins,Heat-Shock Response,Metals, Heavy,Oxidative Stress,Phylogeny,Reactive Oxygen Species"

33161305,-130,Mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate,Cell death,Mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate drives progression of PINK1-parkin-mediated mitophagy via increasing mitochondrial ROS to exacerbate cytotoxicity.,"Phthalate ester plasticizers are used to improve the plasticity and strength of plastics. One of the most widely used and studied, di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), has been labeled as an endocrine disruptor. The major and toxic metabolic derivative of DEHP, mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), is capable of interfering with mitochondrial function, but its mechanism of action on mitophagy remains elusive. Here, we report that MEHP exacerbates cytotoxicity by amplifying the PINK1-Parkin-mediated mitophagy pathway. First, MEHP exacerbated mitochondrial damage induced by low-dose CCCP via increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and enhanced fragmentation in mitochondria. Second, co-exposure to MEHP and CCCP (""MEHP-CCCP"") induced robust mitophagy. Mechanistically, MEHP-CCCP stabilized PINK1, increased the level of phosphorylated ubiquitin (pSer 65-Ub), and led to Parkin mitochondrial translocation and activation. Third, MEHP-CCCP synergistically caused more cell death, while inhibition of mitophagy, either through chemical or gene silencing, reduced cell death. Finally and importantly, co-treatment with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) completely counteracted the effects of MEHP-CCCP, suggesting that mitochondrial ROS played a vital role in this process. Our results link mitophagy and MEHP cytotoxicity, providing an insight into the potential roles of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in human diseases such as Parkinson's disease.","Phthalic Acids,Reactive Oxygen Species,phthalic acid,Diethylhexyl Phthalate,Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases,parkin protein,Protein Kinases,PTEN-induced putative kinase,mono-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate",,"Algorithms,Animals,Cattle,Environmental Exposure,Estrogens,Molecular Dynamics Simulation,Protein Binding,Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship,Receptors, Estrogen"

To investigate the long-term neurotoxicity of maternal exposure to BPA for offspring, mice were used as the animal model. In this study, pregnant mice (F0) were orally dosed with BPA (i.e. mice from low-, medium- and high-exposed groups were treated with 0.5, 50, 5000 Œºg/kg¬∑bw of BPA per day) until weaning. Then, the first generation (F1) mice were used to generate the F2 ones. The offspring of mice not exposed to BPA served as the control groups. The Y-maze test, comet assay, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining method, Golgi-Cox assay and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) were conducted to study any alterations to learning and memory abilities, the morphological variations in hippocampal neurons and transmitter levels of F1 and F2 mice induced by BPA exposure. Results showed that even a low-dose of maternal BPA exposure could sex-dependently and significantly impair the learning and memory ability of F1 male mice, but not of generation F2. Furthermore, decreased neuron quantities and spine densities in hippocampi were observed in both F1 and F2 generations after maternal BPA exposure. However, DNA damage of brain cells were only limited to F1 offspring, in which DNA damage was only observed in the low-exposed male mice and medium-exposed female mice. Additionally, maternal BPA exposure leads to variations in hippocampal neurotransmitter levels, indicated by the decreased ratio of Glu/GABA in F1 offspring. In conclusion, maternal exposure to an environmental dose of BPA resulted in lasting adverse effects on neurological development for offspring mice.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Neurotransmitter Agents,Phenols,bisphenol A",,"Algorithms,Animals,Computational Biology,Databases, Chemical,Deep Learning,Endocrine Disruptors,Humans,Machine Learning,Mice,Models, Statistical,Protein Binding,Receptors, Estrogen"

Moreover, intergenerational and transgenerational phenotypic changes may be induced by germline exposure (F2) and epigenetic germline transmission (F3) generation, respectively. Here, we assessed reproductive and sociosexual behavioral outcomes of prenatal Aroclor 1221 (A1221), a lightly chlorinated mix of PCBs known to have weakly estrogenic mechanisms of action; estradiol benzoate (EB), a positive control; or vehicle (3% DMSO in sesame oil) in F1-, F2-, and F3-generation male and female rats. Treatment with EDCs was given on embryonic day (E) 16 and 18, and F1 offspring monitored for development and adult behavior. F2 offspring were generated by breeding with untreated rats, phenotyping of F2s was performed in adulthood, and the F3 generation were similarly produced and phenotyped. Although no effects of treatment were found on F1 or F3 development and physiology, in the F2 generation, body weight in males and uterine weight in females were increased by A1221. Mating behavior results in F1 and F2 generations showed that F1 A1221 females had a longer latency to lordosis. In males, the F2 generation showed decreased mount frequency in the EB group. In the F3 generation, numbers of ultrasonic vocalizations were decreased by EB in males, and by EB and A1221 when the sexes were combined. Finally, partner preference tests in the F3 generation revealed that na√Øve females preferred F3-EB over untreated males, and that na√Øve males preferred untreated over F3-EB or F3-A1221 males.

However, the molecular mechanisms involved in these alterations are still unclear. Isoflavones are present in soy-based infant formula, in breast milk after the consumption of soy by the mother and are widely used for the preparation of beverages consumed by toddlers and teenagers. In this sense, we proposed to investigate the effects of soy isoflavone exposure during the prepubertal period, a recognized window of sensitivity for endocrine disruption, over the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) axis. For this, 42 3-week-old male Wistar rats were exposed to 0.5, 5 or 50¬†mg of soy isoflavones/kg from postnatal day (PND) 23 to PND60. We evaluated body growth, age at puberty, serum concentrations of LH, FSH, testosterone and estradiol, and the expression of the transcripts (mRNA) of genes encoding key genes controlling the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) axis. In the hypothalamus, we observed an increase in Esr1 mRNA expression (0.5 and 5¬†mg). In the pituitary, we observed an increase in Gnrhr mRNA expression (50¬†mg), a reduction in Lhb mRNA expression (0.5¬†mg), and a reduction in Ar mRNA expression. In the testis, we observed an increase in Lhcgr mRNA expression (50¬†mg) and a reduction in Star mRNA expression (0.5 and 5¬†mg). The serum levels of LH (5 and 50¬†mg) and FSH (0.5¬†mg) were increased, while testosterone and estradiol were reduced. Puberty was delayed in all groups. Taken together, these results suggest that prepubertal consumption of relevant levels of soy isoflavones disrupts the HPT axis, causing hypergonadotropic hypogonadism and altered expression levels of key genes regulating the axis.","Gonadotropins, Pituitary,Isoflavones,Phytoestrogens,RNA, Messenger,Testosterone,Estradiol,Follicle Stimulating Hormone,Corticosterone","Fetal growrh retardation,PFOS,Placenta,Placental lactogen,Prolactin-like protein","Alkanesulfonic Acids,Animals,Body Weight,Embryo, Mammalian,Female,Fetal Growth Retardation,Fluorocarbons,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Mice,Placental Hormones,Pregnancy,Prolactin,Transcription Factor Pit-1,Trophoblasts"

In addition, improper follicular development and a reduction in antral follicles, corpora lutea, and total healthy ovarian follicles together with an increase in cystic follicles were apparent. Evidence of uterine atrophy, reduction in endometrial gland number, and inflammation and oxidative stress were seen in TBT mice. Further, strong negative correlations were observed between testosterone levels and primordial, primary, and total healthy ovarian follicles. Thus, these data suggest that the subchronic and low dose of TBT exposure impaired ovarian follicular reserve, uterine gland number, and other reproductive features in female mice.","Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Pollutants,Trialkyltin Compounds,tributyltin","Children,Co-exposure,Lead,Mercury,Perfluoroalkyl acids","Alkanesulfonic Acids,Caprylates,Child,Environmental Pollutants,Fluorocarbons,Humans,Lead,Mercury,Nutrition Surveys"
33582643,-129,tetrachlorobisphenol A,Cancer,Insight into the mechanism of tetrachlorobisphenol A (TCBPA)-induced proliferation of breast cancer cells by GPER-mediated signaling pathways.,"Tetrachlorobisphenol A (TCBPA), a chlorinated derivative of bisphenol A, is an endocrine disruptor based on interaction with nuclear estrogen receptor alpha (ERŒ±). However, there is only limited data on the mechanisms through which TCBPA-associated estrogenic activity is related to the membrane G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) pathway. In this study, three human breast cancer cell lines-MCF-7, SKBR3, and MDA-MB-231¬†cells were used to evaluate whether, as well as how, TCBPA at concentration range of 0.001-50¬†ŒºM affect cell proliferation. The role of GPER signaling in TCBPA-induced cell proliferation was studied by analyzing the protein expression and mRNA levels of relevant signal targets. The results showed that low concentrations of TCBPA significantly induced the proliferation of MCF-7, SKBR3, and MDA-MB-231¬†cells, with MCF-7¬†cells being the most sensitive to TCBPA exposure. Low-concentration TCBPA also upregulated the expression of GPER, CyclinD1, c-Myc, and c-Fos proteins, as well as increased the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated-kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) and protein kinase B (Akt). Additionally, the mRNA levels of genes associated with estrogen signaling pathways also increased upon exposure to TCBPA. However, the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and Akt decreased when the cells were treated with GPER inhibitor G15 and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor wortmannin (WM) prior to TCBPA exposure. Besides, the increased proliferation of breast cancer cells induced by TCBPA were also inhibited. In ERŒ±-positive MCF-7¬†cells, TCBPA also upregulated ERŒ± expression, and ERŒ± was found to interact with GPER-mediated signaling. The results indicate that GPER activates the PI3K/Akt and Erk1/2 signal cascades to drive the cell proliferation observed for low concentrations of TCBPA. The presented results suggest a new mechanism by which TCBPA exerts estrogenic action in breast cancer cells, namely, GPER signaling in an ERŒ±-independent manner, and also highlights the potential risks to human health of the usage of TCBPA.","Chlorophenols,Estrogen Receptor alpha,Estrogens,Receptors, Estrogen,Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled,tetrachlorodian",,"Alkylating Agents,Animals,Diethylnitrosamine,Growth Hormone,Liver,Male,Pituitary Gland,Prolactin,Rats,Rats, Wistar,Sex Characteristics"

We have previously examined the endocrine disrupting properties of the agricultural azole fungicides triticonazole and flusilazole. Triticonazole displayed strong androgen receptor (AR) antagonism in¬†vitro, whereas in utero exposure resulted in anti-androgenic effects in¬†vivo evidenced by shorter anogenital distance (AGD) in fetal male rats. Flusilazole displayed strong AR antagonism, but less potent than triticonazole, and disrupted steroidogenesis in¬†vitro, whereas in utero exposure disrupted fetal male plasma hormone levels. To elaborate on how these azole fungicides can disrupt male reproductive development by different mechanisms, and to investigate whether feminization effects such as short AGD in males can also be detected at the transcript level in fetal testes, we profiled fetal testis transcriptomes after in utero exposure to triticonazole and flusilazole by 3'Digital Gene Expression (3'DGE). The analysis revealed few transcriptional changes after exposure to either compound at gestation day 17 and 21. This suggests that the observed influence of flusilazole on hormone production may be by directly targeting steroidogenic enzyme activity in the testis at the protein level, whereas observations of shorter AGD by triticonazole may primarily be due to disturbed androgen signaling in androgen-sensitive tissues. Expression of Calb2 and Gsta2 was altered by flusilazole but not triticonazole and may pinpoint novel pathways of disrupted testicular steroid synthesis.

Asthma is a complex disease caused by genetic and environmental factors. Nonylphenol (NP), a typical endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC), is a major current focus in asthma research. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats (n¬†=¬†8-10 per group) were given a consecutive daily dose of NP (25, 50, or 100¬†mg/kg/day) or an equivalent volume of vehicle by gavage from gestational day 7 until postnatal day (PND) 21. Exposure to 100¬†mg/kg NP increased the body mass of the offspring on PND 43. Perinatal exposure to NP in maternal rats led to a dose-dependent increase of NP level in the lung tissue of the offspring. The numbers of lymphocytes and neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were significantly higher in the 100¬†mg/kg NP group than those in the control. Histopathological examination of the lung showed that exposure to high dose NP resulted in a slightly thickened bronchiolar smooth muscles with inflammatory cell infiltration. In the cytoplasm of type II epithelial cells, osmiophilic lamellar bodies were observed, with emptied lamellar bodies. NP significantly increased the expressions of high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) mRNA and nuclear factor Œ∫B (NF-Œ∫B) mRNA in the lung tissue of the offspring in a dose dependent manner. Similarly, the expressions of HMGB1, NF-Œ∫Bp65 and estrogen receptor-Œ≤ (ER-Œ≤) proteins increased with an increase of NP dose. NP content was positively correlated with the expressions of HMGB1 and NF-Œ∫B mRNA as well as HMGB1, NF-Œ∫Bp65, and ER-Œ≤ proteins in the lung tissue of offspring. Perinatal exposure to NP from the maternal rats might induce airway inflammation in the offspring, which may be due to NP-induced infiltration of inflammatory cells into the airway, and pathological alterations in airway structure as well as abnormal expression patterns of inflammation-related genes, proteins (including HMGB1 and NF-Œ∫B) and estrogen receptor Œ≤.","Phenols,nonylphenol","Alzheimer's Disease,diabetes,endocrine disruptors,estrogens,glucosetransporter 4.,insulin-regulated aminopeptidase","Alzheimer Disease,Aminopeptidases,Cystinyl Aminopeptidase,Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2,Endocrine Disruptors,Humans,Insulin"
33155548,-128,Bisphenol S,Reproductive,Bisphenol S enhances gap junction intercellular communication in ovarian theca cells.,"Gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) is necessary for ovarian function, and it is temporospatially regulated during follicular development and ovulation. At outermost layer of the antral follicle, theca cells provide structural, steroidogenic, and vascular support. Inter- and extra-thecal GJIC is required for intrafollicular trafficking of signaling molecules. Because GJIC can be altered by hormones and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), we tested if any of five common EDCs (bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol S (BPS), bisphenol F (BPF), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), and triphenyltin chloride (TPT)) can interfere with theca cell GJIC. Since most chemicals are reported to repress GJIC, we hypothesized that all chemicals tested, within environmentally relevant human exposure concentrations, will inhibit theca cell GJICs. To evaluate this hypothesis, we used a scrape loading/dye transfer assay. BPS, but no other chemical tested, enhanced GJIC in a dose- and time-dependent manner in ovine primary theca cells. A signal-protein inhibitor approach was used to explore the GJIC-modulatory pathways involved. Phospholipase C and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors significantly attenuated BPS-induced enhanced GJIC. Human theca cells were used to evaluate translational relevance of these findings. Human primary theca cells had a ‚àº40% increase in GJIC in response to BPS, which was attenuated with a MAPK inhibitor, suggestive of a conserved mechanism. Upregulation of GJIC could result in hyperplasia of the theca cell layer or prevent ovulation by holding the oocyte in meiotic arrest. Further studies are necessary to understand in¬†vitro to in¬†vivo translatability of these findings on follicle development and fertility outcomes.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Connexin 43,Hazardous Substances,Phenols,Sulfones,bisphenol F,bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)sulfone,bisphenol A","Alzheimer's disease,cognitive impairment,dementia,impaired sleep,insomnia,sleep disturbance.","Alzheimer Disease,Amyloid beta-Peptides,Cognition,Cognitive Dysfunction,Female,Humans,Male,Risk Factors,Sleep,Sleep Apnea, Obstructive,Sleep Wake Disorders"

ATR has been associated with altered endocrine and reproductive functioning in-vivo exposed during the critical window of development. Thus, the present study investigates the effect of ATR exposure on F1-F2 male progeny exposed through gestation and lactation. F0 dams administered with ATR at doses 2, 10, 70, and 100¬†mg/kg b. wt/day from gestation day 6 to postnatal day 21. The F1 male rats were monitored for sexual maturation and subjected to fertility assessment on PND75. Delayed testicular descent was observed in 10, 70, and 100¬†mg/kg b. wt/day ATR dose with significantly lower serum testosterone, sperm count, and motility with testicular defects in F1 male. Expression of Androgen receptor (AR), Estrogen receptors (ER Œ± and ER Œ≤), StAR, Aromatase, and INSL-3 were upregulated at all doses indicating estrogenic/anti-androgenic activity of ATR. Fertility assessment revealed subfertility in F1 males with high (%) pre- and post-implantation loss at 10, 70, and 100¬†mg/kg b. wt/day dose as compared to control. Further, F2 fetuses exhibited congenital disabilities viz. decreased weight, crown-rump length, and anogenital distance with several other morphological deformities. To conclude, ATR exerted estrogenic and/or anti-androgenic activity with fetotoxic effects through the male germline.","Receptors, Androgen,Receptors, Estrogen,Testosterone,Atrazine","Alzheimer‚Äôs disease,Aryl hydrocarbon receptor,Neurodegeneration,Parkinson‚Äôs disease,Petroleum hydrocarbon","Alzheimer Disease,Animals,Autism Spectrum Disorder,Humans,Hydrocarbons,Parkinson Disease,Petroleum,Systematic Reviews as Topic"

16162846,-128,bisphenol A,Neurological,Neurobiological effects of bisphenol A may be mediated by somatostatin subtype 3 receptors in some regions of the developing rat brain.,"Considerable attention has been focused on environmental disruptors such as the xenoestrogen bisphenol A, which influences reproductive, developmental, and cognitive activities through its interaction with specific neuromediating systems in an estrogen-like fashion. In the present study, the effects of this xenoestrogen proved to be preferentially directed toward hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic somatostatin receptor subtype 3, which displayed a higher binding affinity of its specific nonpeptide agonist L-796-778 than that of L-779-976 (subtype 2). One type of action, with respect to animals treated with vehicle alone, consisted of a very strong (p < 0.001) decrease of somatostatin receptor subtype 3 mRNA levels in layer V of the frontoparietal cortex of adult rats (Sprague-Dawley) after transplacental and lactational exposure to bisphenol A (400 microg/kg/day). Similarly, such treatment in 7-day-old rats was responsible for a very strong reduction of the subtype 3 mRNA levels in the hypothalamic periventricular nuclei and a strong (p < 0.01) increase of the subtype 3 mRNA levels in the ventromedial nuclei. Moreover, even greater upregulated and downregulated activities were reported when subtype 3 mRNA levels were determined in the presence of receptor agonists specific for distinct alpha GABA(A) receptor subunits (alpha(1,5)).

PDCB at a dose of 800 mg/kg/day always reduced uterine and ovarian weights. Intraperitoneal PDCB at doses more than 400 mg/kg/day significantly inhibited the uterotrophic effect of beta-estradiol (E2) in CD-1 (ICR) mice. E2-induced uterotrophy was dose-dependently prevented by 204-400 mg PDCB/kg/day in C57BL/6N (Ah responsive) mice but not DBA/2N (Ah non-responsive) mice.

31597243,-128,Bisphenol A,"Cognitive, Neurological","Memory Function, Neurological, and Immunological Biomarkers in Allergic Asthmatic Mice Intratracheally Exposed to Bisphenol A.","Bisphenol A (BPA) is a major constituent of plastic products, including epoxy resin containers, mobile phones, dental sealants, as well as electronic and medical equipment. BPA is recognized as an endocrine system-disrupting chemical which has toxic effects on the brain and reproductive system. However, little is known about the effects of co-exposure of BPA with allergens on the memory function and neurological as well as immunological biomarker levels. In this study, we examined the effects of intratracheal instillation of BPA on the memory function and neuroimmune biomarker levels using a mouse model of allergic asthma. Male C3H/HeJ Jcl mice were given three doses of BPA (0.0625 pmol, 1.25 pmol, and 25 pmol BPA/animal) intratracheally once a week, and ovalbumin (OVA) intratracheally every other week from 5 to 11 weeks old. At 11 weeks of age, a novel object recognition test was conducted after the final administration of OVA, and the hippocampi and hypothalami of the animals were collected after 24 h. The expression levels of the memory function-related genes N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits, inflammatory cytokines, microglia markers, estrogen receptor-alpha, and oxytocin receptor were examined by real-time RT-PCR (real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) and immunohistochemical methods. Impairment of the novel object recognition ability was observed in the high-dose BPA-exposed mice with allergic asthma. In addition, the allergic asthmatic mice also showed downregulation of neurological biomarkers, such as NMDA receptor subunit NR2B in the hippocampus but no significant effect on immunological biomarkers in the hypothalamus. These findings suggest that exposure to high-dose BPA triggered impairment of memory function in the allergic asthmatic mice. This is the first study to show that, in the presence of allergens, exposure to high-dose BPA may affect memory by modulating the memory function-related genes in the hippocampus.","Air Pollutants,Air Pollutants, Occupational,Benzhydryl Compounds,Biomarkers,Phenols,bisphenol A",,"Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones,Apoptosis,Arginine,Caspase Inhibitors,Cell Death,Cell Survival,Cells, Cultured,Culture Media,Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors,Extracellular Matrix,Fetal Tissue Transplantation,Hepatocyte Growth Factor,Humans,In Situ Nick-End Labeling,Insulin,Insulin Secretion,Islets of Langerhans,Islets of Langerhans Transplantation,Tissue Preservation,Trehalose"
34160118,-128,Triclosan,Cell death,Triclosan regulates the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway through the PI3K/Akt/JNK signaling cascade to induce oxidative damage in neurons.,"Triclosan (TCS), a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, is recognized as an environmental endocrine disruptor. TCS has caused a wide range of environmental, water and soil pollution. TCS is also still detected in food. Due to its high lipophilicity and stability, TCS can enter the human body through biological enrichment and potentially threatenes human health. In recent years, the neurotoxic effects caused by TCS contamination have attracted increasing attention. This study was designed to investigate the mechanism underlying TCS-induced HT-22 cells injury and to explore the effect of TCS on the PI3K/Akt, MAPK, and Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathways in HT-22 cells. In this study, we examined the adverse effects of TCS treatment on ROS generation, and MDA, GSH-Px, and SOD activities. The expression levels of proteins in the Nrf2, PI3K/Akt, MAPK pathways and Caspase-3, BAX, Bcl-2 were measured and quantified by Western blotting. The results showed that TCS could significantly reduce the activity of HT-22 cells, increase the production of intracellular ROS and upregulate the expression of proapoptotic proteins. In addition, TCS promoted an increase in the MDA and SOD levels, and downregulated the GSH-Px activity, and oxidative damage occurred in neurons. The mechanism underlying this toxicity was related to TCS-induced PI3K/Akt/JNK-mediated regulation of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. This result was further confirmed by the specific inhibitors LY294002 and SP600125. In summary, TCS could induce oxidative damage in HT-22 neurons, and activation of the PI3K/Akt/JNK/ Nrf2 /HO-1 signaling cascade was the main mechanism underlying the TCS-induced HT-22 neuronal toxicity.","NF-E2-Related Factor 2,Triclosan,Heme Oxygenase-1,Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt",,"Amino Acid Sequence,Amino Acid Substitution,Animals,Chromogranins,Evolution, Molecular,GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs,Genes, Overlapping,Humans,Molecular Sequence Data,Open Reading Frames"

Cell images were analyzed to assess cytotoxicity and effects on phenotypic endpoints. Only MEHP (100¬†ŒºM) was cytotoxic and only in C18-4 cells. However, several plasticizers had distinct phenotypic effects in all four cell lines. DINP increased Calcein intensity in C18-4 cells, whereas DIDA induced oxidative stress. In TM4 cells, MEHP, and DINCH affected lipid droplet numbers, while DEHTP and DINCH increased oxidative stress. In MA-10 cells, MEHP increased lipid droplet areas and oxidative stress; DINP decreased the number of lysosomes, while DINP, DEHA, and DIDA altered mitochondrial activity. In KGN cells, MEHP, DINP and DINCH increased the number of lipid droplets, whereas DINP decreased the number of lysosomes, increased oxidative stress and affected mitochondria. The Toxicological Priority Index (ToxPi) provided a visual illustration of the cell line specificity of the effects on phenotypic parameters. The lowest administered equivalent doses were observed for MEHP. We propose that this approach may assist in screening alternative plasticizers.","Adipates,Phthalic Acids,Plasticizers,phthalic acid",,"Amino Acid Sequence,Animals,Base Sequence,Humans,Iodide Peroxidase,Molecular Sequence Data,Polymorphism, Genetic,Protein Biosynthesis,Proteins,Selenoproteins,Sequence Homology, Amino Acid"

Increasing evidence has showed that many chemicals with endocrine disrupting effects can disturb lipid metabolism. Whether 4-hexylphenol (4-HP), a widely-used surfactant and a potential endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC), is associated to influence adipogenesis and hepatic lipid accumulation remained to be elucidated. In this study, both the 3T3-L1 differentiation model and oleic acid (OA)-treated HepG2 cells were used to investigate the effects of 4-HP on lipid metabolism, and the underlying estrogen receptor (ER)-involved mechanism was explored using MVLN assay, molecular docking simulation and the antagonist test. The results based on lipid droplet staining and triglyceride accumulation assay showed that 4-HP treatment promoted the adipogenic differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells and increased hepatic cellular OA accumulation in exposure concentration-dependent manners. The study on the elaborated transcription networks indicated that 4-HP activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Œ≥ (PPARŒ≥) as well as the subsequent adipogenic gene program in 3T3-L1 cells. This chemical also induced the increase of OA uptake and decreases of de novo lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation in HepG2 cells. The agonistic activity of 4-HP in triggering ER-mediated pathway was shown to correlate with its perturbation in lipid metabolism, as evidenced by the enhanced development of mature lipid-laden adipocytes and suppression of excessive hepatic lipid accumulation upon its co-treatment with ER antagonist. Altogether, these findings provide new insights into the potential health impacts of 4-HP exposure as it may relate to obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.",,,"Amino Acid Sequence,Animals,Female,Gonadotropins, Pituitary,Humans,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Mutation,Ovary,Pituitary Gland,Receptors, FSH,Receptors, Gonadotropin,Receptors, LH,Structure-Activity Relationship"

32956838,-127,Bisphenol A,Reproductive,Perinatal exposure to Bisphenol A disturbs the early differentiation of male germ cells.,"Understanding the effects of Bisphenol A (BPA) on early germ cell differentiation and their consequences in adult life is an area of growing interest in the field of endocrine disruption. Herein, we investigate whether perinatal exposure to BPA affects the differentiation of male germ cells in early life using a transgenic mouse expressing the GFP reporter protein under the Oct4 promoter. In this model, the expression of GFP reflects the expression of the Oct4 gene. This pluripotency gene is required to maintain the spermatogonial stem cells in an undifferentiated stage. Thus, GFP expression was used as a parameter to evaluate the effect of BPA on early germ cell development. Female pregnant transgenic mice were exposed to BPA by oral gavage, from embryonic day 5.5 to postnatal day 7 (PND7). The effects of BPA on male germ cell differentiation were evaluated at PND7, while sperm quality, testicular morphology, and protein expression of androgen receptor and proliferating cell nuclear antigen were studied at PND130. We found that perinatal/lactational exposure to BPA up-regulates the expression of Oct4-driven GFP in testicular cells at PND7. This finding suggests a higher proportion of undifferentiated spermatogonia in BPA-treated animals compared with non-exposed mice. Moreover, in adulthood, the number of spermatozoa per epididymis was reduced in those animals perinatally exposed to BPA. This work shows that developmental exposure to BPA disturbed the normal differentiation of male germ cells early in life, mainly by altering the expression of Oct4 and exerted long-lasting sequelae at the adult stage, affecting sperm count and testis.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Octamer Transcription Factor-3,Phenols,Pou5f1 protein, mouse,Receptors, Androgen,SOXB1 Transcription Factors,Sox2 protein, mouse,bisphenol A",,"Amygdala,Animals,Aspartic Acid,Creatine,Energy Metabolism,Glutamic Acid,Glutamine,Hippocampus,Lactic Acid,Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy,Male,Prefrontal Cortex,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic,Stress, Psychological,Synaptic Transmission,gamma-Aminobutyric Acid"
32798281,-127,Aroclor 1221,Neurological,Exposure to prenatal PCBs shifts the timing of neurogenesis in the hypothalamus of developing rats.,"The developing brain is highly sensitive to the hormonal milieu, with gonadal steroid hormones involved in neurogenesis, neural survival, and brain organization. Limited available evidence suggests that endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may perturb these developmental processes. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that prenatal exposure to a mixture of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), Aroclor 1221, would disrupt the normal timing of neurogenesis in two hypothalamic regions: the ventromedial nucleus (VMN) and the preoptic area (POA). These regions were selected because of their important roles in the control of sociosexual behaviors that are perturbed in adulthood by prenatal EDC exposure. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to PCBs from Embryonic Day 8 (E8) to E18, encompassing the period of neurogenesis of all hypothalamic neurons. To determine the birth dates of neurons, bromo-2-deoxy-5-uridine (BrdU) was administered to dams on E12, E14, or E16. On the day after birth, male and female pups were perfused, brains immunolabeled for BrdU, and numbers of cells counted. In the VMN, exposure to PCBs significantly advanced the timing of neurogenesis compared to vehicle-treated pups, without changing the total number of BrdU+ cells. In the POA, PCBs did not change the timing of neurogenesis nor the total number of cells born. This is the first study to show that PCBs can shift the timing of neurogenesis in the hypothalamus, specifically in the VMN but not the POA. This result has implications for functions controlled by the VMN, especially sociosexual behaviors, as well as for sexual selection more generally.","Aroclors,Endocrine Disruptors,aroclor 1221,Polychlorinated Biphenyls","Anabaena variabilis,Bisphenol analogues,Cyanobacteria,Microcystis aeruginosa,Toxic effect","Anabaena,Anabaena variabilis,Benzhydryl Compounds,Microcystis,Phenols"

Our recent study demonstrated that Cd-induced BC progression has a strong correlation with miR-374c-5p dysregulation. The aim of our work was to investigate other potential miRNAs involved in Cd-induced BC cell proliferation and metastasis. In our study, the miRNA profiles of Cd-treated T-47D cells (10¬†ŒºM, 72¬†h) were analyzed by miRNA-seq, and our results confirmed that miR-3614-5p was the top downregulated miRNA. Moreover, miR-3614-5p mimic transfection significantly decreased the proliferative ability, migration and invasive ability of BC cell lines (T-47D and MCF-7). Furthermore, we analyzed the overlapping genes from our RNA-seq data and predicted targets from the mirDIP database, and twelve genes (ALDH1A3, FBN1, GRIA3, NOS1, PLD5, PTGER4, RASGRF2, RELN, RNF150, SLC17A4, TG, and TXNRD1) were identified as potential binding targets of miR-3614-5p in the current model. Nonetheless, only miR-3614-5p inhibition caused an increase in TXNRD1 expression upon Cd exposure in T-47D and MCF-7 cell lines. Importantly, luciferase reporter assays further verified that miR-3614-5p suppressed the expression of TXNRD1 by directly binding to the 3'-untranslated region (UTR), and TXNRD1 inhibition significantly repressed the proliferation and metastasis capacity of BC cells upon Cd exposure. Together, our findings demonstrated that Cd exposure repressed the expression of miR-3614-5p, thus activating TXNRD1 expression, which promoted the abnormal proliferation and metastasis of BC cells.","Cadmium,MicroRNAs,TXNRD1 protein, human,Thioredoxin Reductase 1,RNF150 protein, human,Membrane Proteins",,"Anabolic Agents,Androgen Antagonists,Androgen Receptor Antagonists,Animals,Body Weight,Drug Administration Schedule,Drug Combinations,Estrus,Female,Flutamide,Methandrostenolone,Methyltestosterone,Pregnancy,Rats,Rats, Long-Evans,Receptors, Androgen,Sexual Maturation,Stanozolol,Time Factors,Vagina"

We investigated the effects and possible mechanism of action of BPS on adult male C57BL/6 mice. We found that exposure to 200-mg/kg BPS resulted in a significant decrease in the sperm count in the caput/corpus and cauda epididymis, significantly decreased sperm motility, and significantly increased the sperm deformity. Histological evaluation revealed that BPS exposure caused a decrease of spermatozoa in the lumen of seminiferous tubules and a reduction in the proportion of Stage VII or VIII seminiferous tubules in the BPS-treated groups. Furthermore, ultrastructure analysis revealed BPS-induced mitochondrial damage and apoptosis in spermatogenic cells. Moreover, BPS exposure-induced oxidative stress in testicular tissues. Further, dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay showed that BPS induced the apoptosis of spermatogenic cells in a dose-dependent manner. BPS also significantly upregulated cleaved caspase-8, cleaved caspase-9, cleaved caspase-3, Fas, and FasL and significantly downregulated the Bcl-2/Bax ratio. These results suggest that BPS-induced oxidative stress in the testis and spermatogenic cell apoptosis potentially impairs spermatogenesis and sperm function, which may be the mechanism of the reproductive toxicity of BPS.

33297044,-127,Bisphenol A,Reproductive,Bisphenol A attenuates testosterone production in Leydig cells via the inhibition of NR1D1 signaling.,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine-disrupting compound that impairs testosterone synthesis in male mammals. A circadian clock gene deficiency leads to diminished fertility and even infertility in male mice. However, whether circadian clock signaling pathways mediate the suppressive effect of BPA on testosterone synthesis in Leydig cells (LCs) remains unknown. The present study aims to detect the effect of BPA on cellular circadian clock and testosterone synthesis in mouse LCs, and examine the mechanisms underlying NR1D1 signaling. BPA treatment significantly attenuated the transcription levels of Nr1d1 and steroidogenic genes (Hsd3b2 and Hsd17b3) in TM3 cells, but increased other circadian clock gene levels (Per2 and Dbp). BPA treatment also significantly downregulated NR1D1 and StAR protein expression, but upregulated BMAL1 protein expression in TM3 cells. Furthermore, there was a marked decline in testosterone production in BPA-treated TM3 cells. Intraperitoneal injection of BPA profoundly reduced NR1D1 and StAR protein levels and steroidogenic gene transcription levels (Cyp11a1, Hsd3b2, and Hsd17b3), while enhancing BMAL1 protein and other circadian clock gene (Per2 and Dbp) levels in mouse testes. Notably, serum testosterone levels were also drastically reduced in BPA-treated mice. Moreover, SR9009, an NR1D1 agonist, augmented testosterone production in TM3 cells via elevated expression of steroidogenic genes (StAR, Cyp11a1 and Hsd17b3). Conversely, Nr1d1 knockdown inhibited testosterone accumulation and attenuated steroidogenic gene expression. Moreover, treatment with SR9009 partially reversed the BPA effect on the circadian clock and testosterone production.

However, the potential curative effects of pachypodol on testicular toxicity are not available until now. Therefore, this research was proposed to examine the efficiency of pachypodol against PFOS-induced testicular toxicity in adult male rats. The experiments were conducted on Sprague-Dawley rats (n¬†=¬†48), which were equally distributed into four groups: control, PFOS (20¬†mg/kg), PFOS¬†+¬†Pachypodol (20¬†mg/kg¬†+¬†10¬†mg/kg respectively), and Pachypodol (10¬†mg/kg).

The estimated parameters include biochemical markers, spermatogenic indices, hormonal and histopathological profiles. PFOS exposure disturbed the biochemical profile by altering the antioxidant/oxidant balance. For instance, it decreased the activities of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione reductase (GSR) while increasing the concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). PFOS intoxication also led to a notable decline in viability, motility, epididymal sperm count, and the number of HOS coiled-tail sperms, whereas the higher level of abnormality in the head, mid-piece, and tail of sperms were observed. Besides, it lowered luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and plasma testosterone. In addition, PFOS exposure led to histopathological damages in testicles.

34208324,-126,Di-Ethyl Phthalate,Developmental,Prenatal Exposure to Di-Ethyl Phthalate (DEP) Is Related to Increasing Neonatal IgE Levels and the Altering of the Immune Polarization of Helper-T Cells.,"{'b': ['Introduction:', 'Material and methods:', 'Results:', 'Conclusion:'], '#text': 'Phthalates are substances that are added to plastic products to increase their plasticity. These substances are released easily into the environment and can act as endocrine disruptors. Epidemiological studies in children have showed inconsistent findings regarding the relationship between prenatal or postnatal exposure to phthalates and the risk of allergic disease. Our hypothesis is that prenatal exposure to phthalates may contribute to the development of allergies in children.  The objective of this study was to determine the associations between urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations in pregnant women, maternal atopic diathesis, maternal lifestyle, and cord blood IgE. Pregnant mothers and paired newborns (n = 101) were enrolled from an antenatal clinic. The epidemiologic data and the clinical information were collected using standard questionnaires and medical records. The maternal blood and urine samples were collected at 24-28 weeks gestation, and cord blood IgE, IL-12p70, IL-4, and IL-10 levels were determined from the newborns at birth. The link between phthalates and maternal IgE was also assessed. To investigate the effects of phthalates on neonatal immunity, cord blood mononuclear cells (MNCs) were used for cytokine induction in another in vitro experiment.  We found that maternal urine monoethyl phthalate (MEP) (a metabolite of di-ethyl phthalate (DEP)) concentrations are positively correlated with the cord blood IgE of the corresponding newborns. The cord blood IL-12p70 levels of mothers with higher maternal urine MEP groups (high DEP exposure) were lower than mothers with low DEP exposure. In vitro experiments demonstrated that DEP could enhance IL-4 production of cord blood MNCs rather than adult MNCs.  Prenatal DEP exposure is related to neonatal IgE level and alternation of cytokines relevant to Th1/Th2 polarization. This suggests the existence of a link between prenatal exposure to specific plasticizers and the future development of allergies.'}","Phthalic Acids,Immunoglobulin E,phthalic acid","Biology,Contraception,Contraception Research,Contraceptive Agents,Contraceptive Agents, Male,Endocrine System,Family Planning,Gonadotropins,Gonadotropins, Pituitary,Hormones,Literature Review,Male Contraception,Physiology,Reproduction,Spermatogenesis","Androgen Antagonists,Androgens,Contraceptive Agents, Male,Follicle Stimulating Hormone,Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone,Humans,Male,Spermatogenesis"

Moreover, the expression of HO-1 and 8-OHdG, key markers for oxidative stress, was increased in vitro and in vivo following BPA administration, whereas that of OAT1 and OAT, important transporters of the renal proximal tubules, was not altered. Overall, no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL)-dose BPA exposure can decrease renal function by promoting abnormal tubular formation both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we propose that although it does not exhibit life-threatening toxicity, exposure to low levels of BPA can negatively affect homeostasis in the body by means of long-term deterioration of renal proximal tubular function in humans.'}","Actins,bisphenol A,Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase,Sodium","AOP,Calretinin,Endocrine disruption,Ovarian dysgenesis syndrome,Ovary,Proteome","Androgen Antagonists,Animals,Benzhydryl Compounds,Biomarkers,Calbindin 2,Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Pollutants,Female,Humans,Lactation,Parabens,Phenols,Pregnancy,Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects,Rats,Rats, Wistar,Reproduction"
34102488,-126,nonylphenol,"Cognitive, Behavioral, Neurological",Subchronic nonylphenol exposure induced anxiety-like behavior and decreased expressions of regulators of synaptic plasticity in rats.,"Studies have shown that there were associations between endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and anxiety. Nonylphenol (NP) is an EDC with weak estrogen activity. This study aimed to clarify whether subchronic exposure of NP at environmental concentrations induces anxiety-like behavior, and effects of NP on the regulators (NMDAR2B, PSD-95, Synapsin1) expressions of synaptic plasticity in vivo and in vitro experiments. In vivo, 40 male SD rats were randomly divided into 4 groups (each with 10 rats): low dose (0.4¬†mg/kg/day, L-NP), middle-dose (4¬†mg/kg/day, M¬†-¬†NP), high-dose (40¬†mg/kg/day, H-NP) and corn oil (Control) groups.

The concentration of NP in the hippocampus rised with the increase of NP exposure concentration in the treatment groups (F¬†=¬†7.542, P¬†=¬†0.001). Compared with the control group, the residence time in the dark box after NP exposure had extended (F¬†=¬†117.927, P¬†<¬†0.01).

There were more neurons degeneration and nuclear shrinkage in the M¬†-¬†and H- NP groups, while the average number of shrinked neurons increased with the increasing dose of NP exposure. The protein expressions of PSD-95 (F¬†=¬†97.723, P¬†<¬†0.01), Synapsin1 (F¬†=¬†41.797, P¬†<¬†0.01) and NMDAR2B (F¬†=¬†3.440, P¬†=¬†0.036) in the NP group were lower than those of the control. Simultaneously, the expressions of PSD-95, Synapsin1 and NMDAR2B in the hippocampus were down-regulated; the mRNA expression of PSD-95 (F¬†=¬†19.950, P¬†<¬†0.01), Synapsin1 (F¬†=¬†3.498, P¬†=¬†0.035) and NMDAR2B (F¬†=¬†9.293, P¬†<¬†0.01) genes in the hippocampus decreased in the M¬†-¬†and H-NP groups.

35504463,-126,bisphenol A,Metabolic,Sex-specific extracellular matrix remodeling during early adipogenic differentiation by gestational bisphenol A exposure.,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine disrupting chemical known to promote adipose tissue mass in vivo and adipogenesis in vitro. Whether BPA can affect and reprogram early adipogenic differentiation signals that trigger adipogenic differentiation, remains unknown. We hypothesized that gestational BPA exposure results in a preadipocyte phenotype that leads to accelerated adipogenic differentiation, and that this phenotype is sex specific. Primary ovine fetal preadipocytes were derived from control (C) and BPA-exposed during pregnancy and differentiated in vitro. Gestational BPA enhanced lipid accumulation at early stages of differentiation (48¬†h) and this was evident in females but not male-derived fetal preadipocytes. After an RNA sequencing approach, samples were compared as follows: 2 groups (C vs. BPA); 2 sexes (female (F) vs. male (M)); and 2 time points (0¬†h vs. 48 h). Before differentiation, 15 genes were differentially expressed between the C and the BPA-exposed preadipocytes within sex. In BPA-F, extracellular matrix remodeling genes cathepsin K and collagen 5Œ±3 were upregulated compared to C-F. At 48¬†h, BPA-F had 154 genes differentially expressed vs. C-F and BPA-M had 487 genes differentially expressed vs. C-M. Triglyceride and glycerophospholipid metabolism were the most upregulated pathways in BPA-F. Downregulated pathways were associated with extracellular matrix organization in BPA-exposed preadipocytes. These findings are among the first to demonstrate that gestational BPA can modify the fate of adipocyte precursors by altering pathways associated to extracellular matrix components, an often-disregarded, but required aspect of adipogenic differentiation. This work highlights the need to investigate early adipogenic differentiation changes in other obesogenic chemicals.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Phenols,bisphenol A",,"Androgens,Animals,Binding, Competitive,Biomass,COS Cells,Cell Line,Chlorocebus aethiops,Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid,Dose-Response Relationship, Drug,Endocrine Disruptors,Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry,Humans,Receptors, Androgen,Vehicle Emissions"
35654127,-126, 3-Methyl-4-Nitrophenol,"Reproductive, Genetic",The effect of 3-Methyl-4-Nitrophenol on the early ovarian follicle development in mice by disrupting the clock genes expression.,"3-Methyl-4-Nitrophenol (PNMC) is the main degradation product of organophosphate insecticide fenitrothion and a major component of diesel exhaust particles, which is now becoming a widely spread environmental endocrine disruptor. Previous reports showed PNMC exposure can affect the female reproductive system and ovarian function; however, the mechanism remains unclear. The main purpose of this study is to clarify the mechanism underlying the adverse effects of neonatal PNMC treatment on ovarian functions. The neonatal female mice were exposed to 10¬†mg/kg PNMC and the ovaries were collected on the 7th day after birth. The changes of follicular composition in mice ovaries were analyzed by histological staining, which showed that the proportion of primordial follicles in the ovaries treated by PNMC decreased, while the proportion of secondary follicles increased. The ovarian function was also investigated by detecting the expressions of steroidogenic enzymes (Star, Cyp11a1, Hsd3b1, Cyp17a1, Cyp19a1), gonadotropin receptors (Fshr and Lhr), androgen receptor (Ar), and estrogen receptors (Esr1 and Esr2) by immunohistochemistry or/and real-time quantitative PCR. The expression of Hsd3b1, Cyp17a1 and Esr2 were increased significantly in the PNMC exposed ovaries. Moreover, the expression patterns of clock genes (Bmal1, Clock, Per1, Per2, Cry1, Cry2 and Nr1d1) were disrupted in the ovaries after PNMC exposure. Furthermore, either the expression of DNA Methyltransferase Dnmt3b, or the methylation ratio of CpG islands in the upstream of Cry1 promoter regions were significantly decreased in PNMC exposed ovaries. Altogether, these results indicate that PNMC exposure affects follicle development and ovarian function by interfering with the epigenetic modification and disrupting the expression of clock genes.","Cresols,Multienzyme Complexes,Vehicle Emissions,4-nitro-3-cresol","Roundup Ultramax¬Æ,crabs,herbicide,ovary,reproductive aspects,spermatozoa","Androgens,Animals,Brachyura,Dose-Response Relationship, Drug,Endocrine Disruptors,Female,Glycine,Herbicides,Male,Models, Animal,Oocytes,Ovary,Reproduction,Spermatozoa,Vitellogenins,Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Cadmium (Cd) is a potent metalloestrogen that disrupts the endocrine system by mimicking the effects of 17Œ≤-estradiol (E2). In the present study, we demonstrate that similar to E2 and G1, a specific agonist for G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), Cd induces the proliferation, invasion and migration of human WRO and FRO thyroid cancer cells that have endogenous GPER. Moreover, like E2 and G1, Cd leads to a rapid activation of ERK/AKT, and then nuclear translocation of NF-Œ∫B, increased expression of cyclin A and D1, and secretion of IL-8, all of which are significantly attenuated by GPER blockage or knock-down in both WRO and FRO cells. Furthermore, the Cd-induced proliferation, invasion and migration are suppressed either by specific inhibitors for GPER, ERK, AKT and NF-Œ∫B, or by knock-down of GPER. These results suggest that GPER/ERK&AKT/NF-Œ∫B signaling pathway is involved in the Cd-induced proliferation, invasion and migration of GPER-positive thyroid cancer cells.","Cyclin A,Estrogens,GPER1 protein, human,Interleukin-8,NF-kappa B,Receptors, Estrogen,Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled,Cadmium,Cyclin D1,Estradiol,Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt","Androgens,Animals, Laboratory,Behavior,Biology,Clinical Research,Endocrine System,Estrogens,Hormones,Literature Review,Menstrual Cycle,Menstruation,Ovulation,Physiology,Progestational Hormones,Progesterone,Reproduction,Research Methodology,Sex Behavior","Androgens,Animals,Central Nervous System,Estrogens,Female,Haplorhini,Hormones,Male,Menstruation,Progesterone,Sex Factors,Sexual Behavior, Animal,Steroids"

We hypothesized that the aspartame and soft drink induced disturbances in energy production and endocrine function, which play a role in the induction of brain damage. Therefore, we aimed to assess the effect of aspartame and soft drink on brain function and the link between energy status in the brain, oxidative stress and molecular pathways of apoptosis. Thirty rats were randomly assigned to drink water, aspartame (240¬†mg/kg orally) and cola soft drinks (free access) daily for two months. Subchronic intake of aspartame and soft drink significantly disrupted the brain energy production, as indicated by inhibited serum and brain creatine kinase, specifically in soft drink-received rats. Moreover, they substantially altered serum electrolytes (increased Ca and Na, and depleted Cu, Fe, Zn and K levels), and accordingly the related hormonal status (increased T4 and PTH, and lowered T3 and aldosterone levels), particularly in soft drink-received rats reflecting brain damage. Additionally, significant increment of acetylcholine esterase activity concomitant with the reduction of antioxidant molecules (SOD, CAT, GSH-Px and GSH), and induction of malondialdehyde level are precisely indicative of oxidative brain damage. Brain mRNA transcripts of target genes showed that aspartame and soft drink induced upregulation of BAX, Casp3, P27 and Mdm2 (1.5-fold) and down-regulation of Bcl2, suggesting an activation of cellular apoptosis. Collectively, subchronic aspartame and soft drink-induced brain damage in rats may be driven via a mechanism that involves energy production disruption, electrolytes and hormonal imbalance, increased oxidative stress and activation of molecular pathway of neuronal apoptosis.","Antioxidants,Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins,Electrolytes,Hormones,RNA, Messenger,Sweetening Agents,Aspartame","Androgens,Endocrine-disrupting compounds,Estrogens,Livestock,Phayao Lake,Steroid hormones","Androgens,Animals,Chromatography, Liquid,Environmental Monitoring,Estrogens,Estrone,Farms,Lakes,Livestock,Tandem Mass Spectrometry,Thailand,Water Pollutants, Chemical"

33957517,-126,propylparaben,Reproductive,Prenatal exposure to propylparaben at human-relevant doses accelerates ovarian aging in adult mice.,"Embryonic exposure to environmental chemicals may result in specific chronic diseases in adulthood. Parabens, a type of environmental endocrine disruptors widely used in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, have been shown to cause a decline in women's reproductive function. However, whether exposure to parabens during pregnancy also negatively affect the ovarian function of the female offspring in adulthood remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the effects of prenatal propylparaben (PrP) exposure on the ovarian function of adult mice aged 46 weeks, which is equivalent to the age of 40 years in women. Pregnant ICR mice were intraperitoneally injected with human-relevant doses of PrP (i.e., 0, 7.5, 90, and 450¬†mg/kg/day) during the fetal sex determination period-from embryonic day E7.5 to E13.5. Our results revealed that ovarian aging was accelerated in PrP-exposed mice at 46 weeks, with altered regularity of the estrous cycle, decreased serum estrogen (E2) and progesterone (P4) levels, reduced size of the primordial follicle pool, and increased number of atretic follicles. It was found that prenatal exposure to human-relevant doses of PrP exacerbated ovarian oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis, which promoted follicular atresia by activating the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. To compensate, the depletion of primordial follicles was also accelerated by activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in PrP-exposed mice. Moreover, PrP induced hypermethylation of CpG sites in the promoter region of Cyp11a1 (a 17.16-64.28% increase) partly led to the disrupted steroidogenesis, and the altered methylation levels of imprinted genes H19 and Peg3 may also contribute to the phenotypes observed. These remarkable findings highlight the embryonic origin of ovarian aging and suggest that a reduced use of PrP during pregnancy should be advocated.","Parabens,propylparaben","androgen,endocrine,estrogen,glyphosate,steroidogenesis,thyroid","Androgens,Animals,Estrogens,Germany,Glycine,Thyroid Gland,Toxicity Tests,United States,United States Environmental Protection Agency"

Although the mechanism of toxicity of many EDCs have been studied in detail, little work has focused on understanding the mechanisms through which pregnant dams and fetuses protect themselves from EDCs, or if those protective mechanisms are sexually dimorphic in fetuses. In this study, we examined proteomic alterations in the livers of mouse dams and their male and female fetuses induced by vinclozolin, a model antiandrogenic EDC. Dam livers upregulated nine phase I and phase II detoxification pathways and pathway analysis revealed that more pathways are significantly enriched in dam livers than in fetal livers. Phase I and II detoxification proteins are also involved in steroid and steroid hormone biosynthesis and vinclozolin likely alters steroid levels in both the dam and the fetus. The response of the fetal liver proteome to vinclozolin exposure is sexually dimorphic. Female fetal livers upregulated proteins in xenobiotic metabolism pathways, whereas male fetal livers upregulated proteins in oxidative phosphorylation pathways. These results suggest that female fetuses increase protective mechanisms, whereas male fetuses increase ATP production and several disease pathways that are indicative of oxidative damage. Females fetuses upregulate proteins and protective pathways that were similar to the dams whereas males did not. If this sexually dimorphic pattern is typical, then males might generally be more sensitive to EDCs.","Androgen Antagonists,Endocrine Disruptors,Oxazoles,Proteome,Adenosine Triphosphate,vinclozolin",,"Androgens,Anovulation,Female,Humans,Hyperandrogenism,Ovary,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome"

34454012,-125,bis(2-butoxyethyl) phthalate,Reproductive,Effects of bis(2-butoxyethyl) phthalate exposure in utero on the development of fetal Leydig cells in rats.,"Phthalates are plasticizers widely found in the environment. They are potential endocrine disruptors. Bis(2-butoxyethyl) phthalate (BBOP) is a unique phthalate that contains oxygen atoms in the carbon backbone. Little is known about its reproductive and developmental toxicity. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of BBOP on fetal Leydig cell development after in utero exposure to rats. Sprague Dawley pregnant dams were randomly allocated into 6 groups, and were gavaged with BBOP (0, 10, 100, 250, 500, and 1000‚Äâmg/kg body weight/day) from gestational day (GD) 14-21. Seven of the 8 dams in the 1000‚Äâmg/kg BBOP group died before giving birth. Twelve of the 20 dams in the 500‚Äâmg/kg BBOP group had whole litter loss. BBOP significantly reduced the body weight of dams and male offspring and serum testosterone level and anogenital distance of male fetus on GD 21 at 500‚Äâmg/kg. BBOP markedly increased fetal Leydig cell proliferation and number at 500‚Äâmg/kg while inducing their abnormal aggregation at 250 and 500‚Äâmg/kg. BBOP down-regulated the expression of Lhcgr, Scarb1, Star, Cyp11a1, Hsd3b1, Cyp17a1, Hsd17b3, Insl3, and Nr5a1 at various doses while up-regulating the expression of Sertoli cell gene Fshr and Sox9. The phosphorylation of AKT1, AKT2, and ERK1/2 was also markedly reduced by BBOP. In conclusion, BBOP in utero exposure can disrupt fetal Leydig cell development, possibly via the mechanism that may include inhibiting the phosphorylation of AKT1, AKT2, and ERK1/2.","Phthalic Acids,phthalic acid,Cholesterol Side-Chain Cleavage Enzyme,Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt,Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases",,"Angiotensin II,Animals,Blood-Brain Barrier,Capillary Permeability,Humans,Hypertension,Sympathetic Nervous System"

18573533,-125,arsenic,Cognitive,Moderate perinatal arsenic exposure alters neuroendocrine markers associated with depression and increases depressive-like behaviors in adult mouse offspring.,"Arsenic is one of the most common heavy metal contaminants found in the environment, particularly in water. We examined the impact of perinatal exposure to relatively low levels of arsenic (50 parts per billion, ppb) on neuroendocrine markers associated with depression and depressive-like behaviors in affected adult C57BL/6J mouse offspring. Whereas most biomedical research on arsenic has focused on its carcinogenic potential, a few studies suggest that arsenic can adversely affect brain development and neural function. Compared to controls, offspring exposed to 50 parts per billion arsenic during the perinatal period had significantly elevated serum corticosterone levels, reduced whole hippocampal CRFR 1 protein level and elevated dorsal hippocampal serotonin 5HT 1A receptor binding and receptor-effector coupling. 5HT 1A receptor binding and receptor-effector coupling were not different in the ventral hippocampal formation, entorhinal or parietal cortices, or inferior colliculus. Perinatal arsenic exposure also significantly increased learned helplessness and measures of immobility in a forced swim task. Taken together, these results suggest that perinatal arsenic exposure may disrupt the regulatory interactions between the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the serotonergic system in the dorsal hippocampal formation in a manner that predisposes affected offspring to depressive-like behavior. These results are the first to demonstrate that relatively low levels of arsenic exposure during development can have long-lasting adverse effects on behavior and neurobiological markers associated with these behavioral changes.","Receptors, Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone,Triglycerides,Tritium,Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1A,gamma-Aminobutyric Acid,CRF receptor type 1,1,2-dilinolenoyl-3-(4-aminobutyryl)propane-1,2,3-triol,Arsenic,Corticosterone","Drugs,Endocrine disruptors,Environmental toxicants,Epidrugs,Hypoxia,SARS-CoV-2","Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2,COVID-19,Epigenesis, Genetic,Gene Expression Regulation,Hazardous Substances,Humans,SARS-CoV-2,Virus Internalization"
34680063,-125,Bisphenol A,Cell damage,Bisphenol A Induces Accelerated Cell Aging in Murine Endothelium.,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is a widespread endocrine disruptor affecting many organs and systems. Previous work in our laboratory demonstrated that BPA could induce death due to necroptosis in murine aortic endothelial cells (MAECs). This work aims to evaluate the possible involvement of BPA-induced senescence mechanisms in endothelial cells. The Œ≤-Gal assays showed interesting differences in cell senescence at relatively low doses (100 nM and 5 ¬µM). Western blots confirmed that proteins involved in senescence mechanisms, p16 and p21, were overexpressed in the presence of BPA. In addition, the UPR (unfolding protein response) system, which is part of the senescent phenotype, was also explored by Western blot and qPCR, confirming the involvement of the PERK-ATF4-CHOP pathway (related to pathological processes). The endothelium of mice treated with BPA showed an evident increase in the expression of the proteins p16, p21, and CHOP, confirming the results observed in cells. Our results demonstrate that oxidative stress induced by BPA leads to UPR activation and senescence since pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in BPA-treated cells reduced the percentage of senescent cells prevented the overexpression of proteins related to BPA-induced senescence and reduced the activation of the UPR system. The results suggest that BPA participates actively in accelerated cell aging mechanisms, affecting the vascular endothelium and promoting cardiovascular diseases.","Atf4 protein, mouse,Benzhydryl Compounds,Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16,Ddit3 protein, mouse,Phenols,Activating Transcription Factor 4,Transcription Factor CHOP,PERK kinase,eIF-2 Kinase,bisphenol A,Acetylcysteine",,"Animal Feed,Animals,Body Size,Dose-Response Relationship, Drug,Larva,Metamorphosis, Biological,Methylmercury Compounds,Time Factors,Triiodothyronine,Water Pollutants, Chemical,Xenopus"

32956863,-125,Chlorpyrifos,Cancer,Chlorpyrifos subthreshold exposure induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cells.,"Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is one of the most frequently used pesticide in extensive agriculture around the world and can be incorporated by humans and animals with possible consequences on health. The effects of this pesticide on carcinogenesis are not clear and there is no consensus concerning the risks of this compound. In previous work, we demonstrated that CPF induces proliferation of breast cancer cells both in vivo and in vitro. In this work we investigate whether CPF promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in breast cancer cells. Herein, we demonstrate that 50¬†ŒºM CFP induces invasion in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231¬†cells. In addition, 0.05 and 50¬†ŒºM CPF increases migration in both cell lines. In MCF-7¬†cells, 0.05 and 50¬†ŒºM CPF increase the metalloprotease MMP2 expression and decrease E-Cadherin and Œ≤-Catenin expression diminishing their membrane location. Furthermore, 50¬†ŒºM CPF induces Vimentin expression and Slug nuclear translocation in MCF-7¬†cells. 0.05 and 50¬†ŒºM CPF increase MMP2 gelatinolytic activity and expression, decrease Œ≤-Catenin expression and increase Vimentin expression in MDA-MB-231¬†cells. Inhibition of the oncoprotein c-Src reverses all the effects induced by CPF in MDA-MB-231 but not in MCF-7 indicating that c-Src is a kinase with a crucial role in the cells which grow in an estrogen-independent way. In MCF-7¬†cells both c-Src and estrogen receptor alpha must be blocked to completly inhibit the CPF-mediated effects. Our results show for the first time that the exposure to subthreshold concentrations of CPF promotes the modulation of EMT-molecular markers and pathways. These results, together with the ubiquitous distribution of the pesticide CPF, make it of utmost importance to take measures to minimize the risk of exposure to this compound.","ESR1 protein, human,Endocrine Disruptors,Estrogen Receptor alpha,Pesticides,CSK Tyrosine-Protein Kinase,CSK protein, human,MMP2 protein, human,Matrix Metalloproteinase 2,Chlorpyrifos","Bisphenol,Determiation,Feed,Post-column infusion,UPLC-MS/MS","Animal Feed,Benzhydryl Compounds,Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid,Limit of Detection,Linear Models,Phenols,Reproducibility of Results,Tandem Mass Spectrometry"

33398767,-125,Bisphenol A,Neurological,Melatonin abated Bisphenol A-induced neurotoxicity via p53/PUMA/Drp-1 signaling.,"Bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine disruptor, is widely used in the manufacture of different daily life products. Accumulating evidence supports the association between the increasing incidence of neurodegenerative diseases and the BPA level in the environment. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective role of melatonin against BPA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction-mediated apoptosis in the brain. Herein, adult Sprague Dawley rats were administrated (subcutaneously) with BPA (100 Œºg/kg BW, 1 mg/kg BW, and 10 mg/kg BW) and melatonin (4 mg/kg BW) for 16 days. Our results showed BPA exposure significantly increased the oxidative stress as demonstrated by increased free radicals (ROS), TBARs level, disrupted cellular architecture, and decreased antioxidant enzymes including SOD, CAT, APX, POD, and GSH levels. Additionally, BPA treatment increased the expression of PUMA, p53, and Drp-1 resulting in apoptosis in the brain tissue of rats. However, melatonin treatment significantly attenuated BPA-induced toxic effects by scavenging ROS, boosting antioxidant enzyme activities, and interestingly enervated brain apoptosis by normalizing p53, PUMA, and Drp-1 expressions at both transcriptional and translational level. Moreover, the brain tissue histology also revealed the therapeutic potential of melatonin by normalizing the cellular architecture. Conclusively, our finding suggests that melatonin could alleviate oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction-linked apoptosis, rendering its neuroprotective potential against BPA-induced toxicity.","Antioxidants,Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins,Benzhydryl Compounds,Phenols,Tumor Suppressor Protein p53,Melatonin,bisphenol A",,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Apoptosis,Female,Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 1,Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 2,Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3,Insulin-Like Growth Factor II,Insulin-Secreting Cells,Liver,Male,Malnutrition,Maternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena,Pancreas,Rats,Rats, Wistar,Signal Transduction"
33360214,-125,Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate,Reproductive,LncRNAs activate longevity regulation pathway due to aging of Leydig cells caused by DEHP exposure: A transcriptome-based study.,"Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), one of the most commonly used endocrine-disrupting chemicals, has been shown to cause reproductive dysfunction in humans and animal models. However, very few studies have investigated the impact of DEHP at the post-transcriptional level in mouse testes, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present research, TM3 Leydig cells were treated with 200¬†¬µM phthalic acid mono-2-ethylhexyl ester (MEHP, bio-metabolite of DEHP), and then the mRNA and lncRNA sequencing of TM3 Leydig cells was performed. Mice were exposed prepubertally to 0 or 500¬†mg DEHP/kg/day. RNA sequencing of mouse testes was performed to verify the RNA-seq results in vitro. The expression patterns of relevant genes and proteins were verified using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blotting. DEHP and MEHP exposure led to testicular damage and accelerated cell aging via ROS accumulation. RNA sequencing analyses indicated that FOXO signaling and longevity regulation pathways were activated in resistance to ROS accumulation. FOXO signaling and longevity regulation pathway-related genes and proteins were also activated. By constructing a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network, we observed that the ceRNA network might play a role in regulating FOXO signaling and longevity regulation pathways in response to excessive ROS accumulation and cell aging. In summary, our data here suggests that the ceRNA network may play a role in regulating FOXO signaling and longevity pathways in response to DEHP exposure in mouse testes.","Endocrine Disruptors,Phthalic Acids,RNA, Long Noncoding,phthalic acid,Diethylhexyl Phthalate",,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Aroclors,Brain,Endocrine Disruptors,Female,Finches,Male,Ovum,Vocalization, Animal"

In vitro studies have indicated that IAA is one of the most cyto- and genotoxic DBPs. In humans, DBPs have been epidemiologically associated with reproductive dysfunction. In mouse ovarian culture, IAA exposure significantly inhibits antral follicle growth and reduces estradiol production. Despite this evidence, little is known about the effects of IAA on the other components of the reproductive axis: the hypothalamus and pituitary. We tested the hypothesis that IAA disrupts expression of key neuroendocrine factors and directly induces cell damage in the mouse pituitary. We exposed adult female mice to IAA in drinking water in vivo and found 0.5 and 10‚Äâmg/l IAA concentrations lead to significantly increased mRNA levels of kisspeptin (Kiss1) in the arcuate nucleus although not affecting Kiss1 in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus. Both 10‚Äâmg/l IAA exposure in vivo and 20‚ÄâŒºM IAA in vitro reduced follicle stimulating hormone (FSHŒ≤)-positive cell number and Fshb mRNA expression. IAA did not alter luteinizing hormone (LHŒ≤) expression in vivo although exposure to 20‚ÄâŒºM IAA decreased expression of Lhb and glycoprotein hormones, alpha subunit (Cga) mRNA in vitro. IAA also had toxic effects in the pituitary, inducing DNA damage and P21/Cdkn1a expression in vitro (20‚ÄâŒºM IAA) and DNA damage and Cdkn1a expression in vivo (500‚Äâmg/l). These data implicate IAA as a hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis toxicant and suggest the pituitary is directly affected by IAA exposure.","Drinking Water,Iodoacetic Acid",,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Brain,Brain Chemistry,Cell Count,Disease Susceptibility,Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental,Female,Handling, Psychological,Mast Cells,Nerve Growth Factors,Pregnancy,Rats,Rats, Inbred Lew"

In this study, we demonstrate that BPAF induces RIPK1-inflammasome axis-mediated necroptosis in platelets, increasing procoagulant platelet levels in vivo and in vitro. We also show that BPAF-induced rise in procoagulant platelets worsens pulmonary thromboembolism in vivo. The elevated procoagulant platelets are shown to increase platelet-neutrophil/monocyte aggregates that mediate pathogenesis of CVD, thrombosis, and chronic inflammatory diseases. Our results demonstrate the toxic effects of BPAF on platelets and how it propagates the clinical complications by elevating procoagulant platelet numbers. Altogether, our study sends a cautionary message against extensive use of BPAF in the plastic and rubber industries, resulting in frequent human exposure to it, thus endangering platelet functions.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Inflammasomes,Phenols,RIPK1 protein, human,Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases,4,4'-hexafluorisopropylidene diphenol",,"Animals,Animals, Suckling,Bone Marrow,Female,Infertility, Male,Lymphoid Tissue,Male,Maternal Exposure,Milk,Nitriles,Pesticides,Pregnancy,Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects,Pyrethrins,Rats,Rats, Wistar,Testis,Testosterone"

33910022,-124,clotrimazole,Reproductive,Human-relevant concentrations of the antifungal drug clotrimazole disrupt maternal and fetal steroid hormone profiles in rats.,"Clotrimazole is a non-prescription and broad-spectrum antifungal drug sold under brand names such as Canesten¬Æ and Lotrimin¬Æ. It is used to treat different types of fungal infections, from oral thrush to athlete's foot and vaginal mycosis. The level of exposure to clotrimazole is uncertain, as the exact usage amongst self-medicating patients is unclear. Recent studies have raised potential concern about the unsupervised use of clotrimazole during pregnancy, especially since it is a potent inhibitor of CYP enzymes of the steroidogenesis pathway. To address some of these concerns, we have assessed the effects of intrauterine exposure to clotrimazole on developing rat fetuses. By exposing pregnant rats to clotrimazole 25 or 75¬†mg/kg bw/day during gestation days 7-21, we obtained internal fetal concentrations close to those observed in humans. These in vivo data are in strong agreement with our physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBK)-modelled levels. At these doses, we observed no obvious morphological changes to the reproductive system, nor shorter male anogenital distance; a well-established morphometric marker for anti-androgenic effects in male offspring. However, steroid hormone profiles were significantly affected in both maternal and fetal plasma, in particular pronounced suppression of estrogens was seen. In fetal testes, marked up-concentration of hydroxyprogesterone was observed, which indicates a specific action on steroidogenesis. Since systemic clotrimazole is rapidly metabolized in humans, relevant exposure levels may not in itself cause adverse changes to the reproductive systems. Its capacity to significantly alter steroid hormone concentrations, however, suggests that clotrimazole should be used with caution during pregnancy.","Antifungal Agents,Biomarkers,Endocrine Disruptors,Estrogens,Gonadal Steroid Hormones,Hydroxyprogesterones,Clotrimazole",,"Animals,Anovulation,Body Weight,Coumestrol,Diet,Eating,Estrogens,Estrogens, Non-Steroidal,Female,Isoflavones,Lactation,Luteinizing Hormone,Phytoestrogens,Plant Preparations,Plants, Edible,Pregnancy,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Sexual Maturation,Syndrome"

The latest studies reported that benzene exposure was associated with many metabolic disorders, while the effect of benzene exposure on adipose tissue remains unclear. We sought to investigate the effect using  and  experiments. Male adult C57BL/6J mice were exposed to benzene at 0, 1, 10 and 100 mg/kg body weight by intragastric gavage for 4 weeks. Mature adipocytes from 3T3-L1 cells were exposed to hydroquinone (HQ) at 0, 1, 5 and 25 ŒºM for 24 hours. Besides the routine hematotoxicity, animal experiments also displayed significant body fat content decrease from 1 mg/kg. Interestingly, the circulating non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) level increased from the lowest dose  < 0.05). Subsequent analysis indicated that body fat content decrease may be due to atrophy of white adipose tissue (WAT) upon benzene exposure. The average adipocyte area of WAT decreased significantly even from 1 mg/kg with no significant changes in total number of adipocytes. The percentages of small and large adipocytes in WAT began to significantly increase or decrease from 1 mg/kg (all  < 0.05), respectively. Critical genes involved in lipogenesis and lipolysis were dysregulated, which may account for the disruption of lipid homeostasis. The endocrine function of WAT was also disordered, manifested as significant decrease in adipokine levels, especially the leptin.  cell experiments displayed similar findings in decreased fat content, dysregulated critical lipid metabolism genes, and disturbed endocrine function of adipocytes after HQ treatment. Pearson correlation analysis showed positive correlations between white blood cell (WBC) count with WAT fat content and plasma leptin level ( = 0.330, 0.344, both  < 0.05). This study shed light on the novel aspect that benzene exposure could induce lipodystrophy and disturb endocrine function of WAT, and the altered physiology of WAT might in turn affect benzene-induced hematotoxicity and metabolic disorders.

The role of phthalates in acquired drug resistance remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) on acquired drug resistance in breast cancer. MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were exposed to long-term physiological concentration of DEHP for more than three months. Long-exposure DEHP permanently attenuated the anti-proliferative effect of doxorubicin with estrogen receptor-independent activity even after withdrawal of DEHP. Long term DEHP exposure significantly reduced ROS (O) level in MDA-MB-231 cells while increased in MCF7 cells. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters possess a widely recognized mechanism of drug resistance and are considered a target for drug therapy. Upregulation of ABC family proteins, ABCB-1 and ABCC-1 observed in DEHP-exposed clones compared to doxorubicin-resistant (DoxR) and parental MDA-MB-231 cells. A viability assay showed enhanced multidrug resistance in DEHP-exposed clones against Dox, topotecan, and irinotecan. Inhibition of ABC transporters with tariquidar, enhanced drug cytotoxicity through increased drug accumulation reversing acquired multidrug resistance in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Tariquidar enhanced Dox cytotoxicity by increasing intracellular ROS production leading to caspase-3 mediated apoptosis. Activation of PI3K/Akt signaling enhanced proliferation and growth of DEHP-exposed MDA-MB-231 cells. Overall, long-term DEHP exposure resulted in acquired multidrug resistance by upregulating ABCB-1 and ABCC1; apart from proliferation PI3K/Akt may be responsible for acquired drug resistance through ABC transporter upregulation.

Developmental neurotoxicity is a primary concern for thyroid disrupting chemicals yet correlating the impact of chemically induced changes in serum T4 to perturbed brain development remains elusive. A number of thyroid-specific neurodevelopmental assays have been proposed, based largely on the model thyroid hormone synthesis inhibitor propylthiouracil (PTU). This study examined whether thyroid disrupting chemicals acting distinct from synthesis inhibition would result in the same alterations in brain as expected with PTU. The perfluoroalkyl substance perfluorohexane sulfonate (50‚Äâmg/kg/day) and the antimicrobial Triclosan (300‚Äâmg/kg/day) were administered to pregnant rats from gestational day 6 to postnatal day (PN) 21, and a number of PTU-defined assays for neurotoxicity evaluated. Both chemicals reduced serum T4 but did not increase thyroid stimulating hormone. Both chemicals increased expression of hepatic metabolism genes, while thyroid hormone-responsive genes in the liver, thyroid gland, and brain were largely unchanged. Brain tissue T4 was reduced in newborns, but despite persistent T4 reductions in serum, had recovered in the PN6 pup brain.

Acrylamide (AA) is a compound formed spontaneously during heat processing of some foods that are mainly consumed by children and adolescents. In this study, we evaluated the prepubertal AA exposure effects on male adult reproductive physiology using a prepubertal experimental model to analyze the pubertal development, spermatogenesis hormones levels and genes expression involved in male reproductive function. This study is the first one to use the validated protocol to correlate the AA exposure with puberty development, as well as the AA-induced endocrine disrupting effects on reproductive axis. AA did not affect the age at puberty, the reproductive organ's weight and serum hormonal levels. AA reduces spermatogenesis, induces morphological and functional defects on sperm and alters transcript expression of sexual hormone receptors (Ar and Esr2), the transcript expression of Tnf, Egr2, Rhcg and Lrrc34. These findings suggest that excessive AA consumption may impair their reproductive capacity at adulthood, despite no changes in hormonal profile being observed.","Cation Transport Proteins,Early Growth Response Protein 2,Egr2 protein, rat,Endocrine Disruptors,Estrogen Receptor beta,Membrane Glycoproteins,Receptors, Androgen,Repressor Proteins,Rh type C glycoprotein, rat,Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha,Acrylamide",,"Animals,Antineoplastic Agents,Cell Line, Tumor,Cell Survival,Cyproterone Acetate,Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1,Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic,Humans,Mice,Neoplasms,Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon,Transcriptional Activation"
33223173,-123,di-isononyl phthalate,Metabolic,Postnatal exposure to DINP was associated with greater alterations of lipidomic markers for hepatic steatosis than DEHP in postweaning mice.,"The toxicity of the endocrine disruptor di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) has been extensively studied for its hormonal dysregulation, obesogenic effect and associated metabolic diseases. DEHP's primary substitute di-isononyl phthalate (DINP), however, although increased in annual production globally, requires better understanding of its health effect. Our previous work reported disruptions in plasma lipid profiles, but the metabolic responses following phthalate exposure in the liver, particularly the entire hepatic lipidome, have been lacking. A targeted lipidomic technique was applied to accurately quantify a total of 363 lipid species in the liver of neonatal mice after exposure to a daily dose of 4.8¬†mg/kg body weight/day from birth throughout lactation. Distinct patterns of disruption for each sum of lipid classes or sub-classes between the genders were the most noticeable. Following DINP administration, female pups were subject to greater changes in phosphatidylethanolamines, bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate and ceramides. In contrast, the males exhibited less changes in the phosphoglycerol backbone-based molecules, whereas glycerol and cholesterol esters were more disrupted by DINP. DEHP, however, induced less changes overall compared to DINP. These findings highlighted the predominant lipidomic disruption of DINP on glycerol (diacylglycerides and triacylglycerides) and/or cholesterol (in ester or free form) molecules in neonatal mice across genders, suggesting the genesis of hepatic steatosis occurring at as early as post weaning. Collectively, these findings question the suitability of DINP as a safe DEHP substitute and warrant further investigation on longer-term exposure to elucidate its effect on chronic liver diseases.","Phthalic Acids,phthalic acid,Diethylhexyl Phthalate",,"Animals,Antineoplastic Agents,Drug Resistance,Energy Metabolism,Humans,Neoplasms,Neoplasms, Experimental"
34508824,-123,Triadimefon,Adrenal,Triadimefon suppresses fetal adrenal gland development after in utero exposure.,"Triadimefon is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent, which is widely used in agriculture to control mold and fungal infections. It is considered an endocrine disruptor. Whether triadimefon exposure can inhibit the development of fetal adrenal glands and the underlying mechanism remain unclear. Thirty-two pregnant female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups. Dams were gavaged triadimefon (0, 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg/day) daily for 10 days from gestational day (GD) 12 to GD 21. Triadimefon significantly reduced the thickness of the zona fasciculata of male fetuses at 100 mg/kg, although it did not change the thickness of the zona glomerulosa. It significantly reduced the serum aldosterone levels of male fetuses at a dose of 100 mg/kg, and significantly reduced serum corticosterone and adrenocorticotropic hormone levels at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg. Triadimefon significantly down-regulated the expression of Agtr1, Mc2r, Star, Cyp11b1, Cyp11b2, Igf1, Nr5a1, Sod2, Gpx1, and Cat, but did not affect the mRNA levels of Scarb1, Cyp11a1, Cyp21, Hsd3b1, and Hsd11b2. Triadimefon markedly reduced AT1R, CYP11B2, IGF1, NR5A1, and MC2R protein levels. Triadimefon significantly reduced the phosphorylation of AKT1 and ERK1/2 at 100 mg/kg without affecting the phosphorylation of AKT2. In contrast, it significantly increased AMPK phosphorylation at 100 mg/kg. In conclusion, exposure to triadimefon during gestation inhibits the development of fetal adrenal cortex in male fetuses. This inhibition is possibly due to the reduction of several proteins required for the synthesis of steroid hormones, and may be involved in changes in antioxidant contents and the phosphorylation of AKT1, ERK1/2, and AMPK.","Antioxidants,Endocrine Disruptors,Fungicides, Industrial,Triazoles,triadimefon",,"Animals,Antioxidants,Basement Membrane,Biomarkers,Diethylhexyl Phthalate,Female,Fetus,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Genistein,Germ Cells,Leydig Cells,Male,NF-E2-Related Factor 2,Organ Culture Techniques,Oxidation-Reduction,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Sertoli Cells,Testis,Testosterone"
34875267,-123,hexabromobenzene,Metabolic,Impact of brominated flame retardants on lipid metabolism: An in vitro approach.,"Brominated flame retardants (BFRs) are chemicals employed to lower the flammability of several objects. These endocrine disruptor chemicals are lipophilic and persistent in the environment. Due to these characteristics some have been restricted or banned by the European Union, and replaced by several new chemicals, the novel BFRs (NBFRs). BFRs are widely detected in human samples, such as adipose tissue and some were linked with altered thyroid hormone levels, liver toxicity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome in humans. However, the disturbance in lipid metabolism caused by BFRs with emphases to NBFRs remains poorly understood. In this study, we used a pre-adipocyte (3T3-L1) cell line and a hepatocyte (HepG2) cell line to investigate the possible lipid metabolism disruption caused by four BFRs: hexabromobenzene (HBB), pentabromotoluene (PBT), 2-ethylhexyl-2,3,4,5-tetrabromobenzoate (TBB) and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD). For that purpose, proliferation and Oil Red O assays, as well as, medium fatty acids profile evaluation using Gas chromatography and RNA extraction for quantitative RT-PCR assays were performed. We detected a significant reduction in the proliferation of preadipocytes and an increased lipid accumulation during differentiation caused by HBB. This BFR also lead to a significant increased expression of IL-1Œ≤ and decreased expression of PGC-1Œ± and adiponectin. Nevertheless, PBT, TBB and HBCD show to increase lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. PBT also display a significant increase of PPARŒ≥ gene expression. Lipid accumulation in the cells can occur by diverse mechanisms depending on the BFR. These results highlight the importance of endocrine disruptor compounds in obesity etiopathogeny.","Flame Retardants,Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers,Hydrocarbons, Brominated","antioxidants,bisphenol A,diseases,endocrine disruptors,stress","Animals,Antioxidants,Benzhydryl Compounds,DNA Breaks,Endocrine Disruptors,Humans,Lipid Peroxidation,Models, Animal,Mutagenicity Tests,Phenols,Poisoning"

Moreover, DEHP is known to promote transgenerational inheritance of adult-onset disease in subsequent generations after maternal exposure during fetal gonadal development. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway has been implicated in germ cell survival following testicular damage. In this study, a F0 gestation DEHP exposure and transgenerational inheritance testis injury model was established to study the testis injury phenotype and the expression and activation of members of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in the testis of F1-F3 generation mice. We found that the bodyweight and the anogenital distance (AGD) are reduced only in F1 mice, the sperm motility and deformity decreased in F1-F3 mice, and the testicular histomorphology damagedin F1-F3 mice; however the sperm motility and deformity rates are increased and the histomorphological injury is repaired during the transgenerational process. We also found the activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is enhanced in F1 and F2, and the number of apoptotic cells is decreased in F3 generation mice compared to the control group. These results suggest that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway may be activated to promote the proliferation and differentiation and protect testicular cells from apoptosis in the F1 and F2 generation mice after direct exposure to DEHP.","Diethylhexyl Phthalate,Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt","Endocrine disruption,Glyphosate,Gut microbiome,Herbicide,Oxidative status,Residue,Testosterone","Animals,Antioxidants,Coturnix,Female,Gastrointestinal Microbiome,Glycine,Herbicides,Humans,Male"

It was shown previously that in utero and lactational (IUL) exposure to TCDD resulted in a reduction in serum estradiol concentrations; however, the mechanism for this remains unknown. In the current study, the effects of perinatal exposure to TCDD on the pituitary-ovarian axis were examined. Pregnant rats were given a single oral dose of 1 microg TCDD/kg or vehicle as control on gestation Day 15, and female pups were killed on postnatal Day 21. Pituitaries were assayed for gonadotropin beta-subunit mRNA; additional pituitaries were cultured for 4 h and the media were assayed for FSH. Gonadotropin receptor mRNAs from vehicle- and TCDD-exposed animals were compared, with some ovaries cultured and the media assayed for estrogen secretion. LH, FSH, progesterone, and androstenedione concentrations were determined in serum. IUL exposure to TCDD resulted in a significant reduction of pituitary FSHbeta mRNA. Although estrogen output was shown to be reduced, neither serum FSH nor LH concentration was increased significantly, and FSH secretion in vitro was not altered. Similarly, serum progesterone and androstenedione were not altered by TCDD exposure, while in vitro estrogen secretion was significantly reduced. These data suggest that TCDD did not act on serum gonadotropin concentrations. The reduction in the concentration of serum estrogen appears to result from direct or indirect actions on the ovary at some point following androstenedione production.","Environmental Pollutants,Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins,RNA, Messenger,Receptors, FSH,Receptors, LH,Estradiol,Luteinizing Hormone,Follicle Stimulating Hormone","Anxiety,Bisphenol A,Depression,Endocrine disruption,Perinatal exposure,Stress","Animals,Anxiety,Behavior, Animal,Benzhydryl Compounds,Brain,Depression,Endocrine Disruptors,Endocrine System,Environmental Exposure,Female,Humans,Phenols,Pregnancy,Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects,Stress, Psychological"
35569583,-122,Bisphenol S,Genetic,Bisphenol S induces Agrp expression through GPER1 activation and alters transcription factor expression in immortalized hypothalamic neurons: A mechanism distinct from BPA-induced upregulation.,"The increasing prevalence of obesity around the world has brought concern upon ubiquitously present obesogenic environmental compounds, such as bisphenol A (BPA). Increasingly tightened regulations on the industrial use of BPA have prompted a transition to a structurally similar alternative, bisphenol S (BPS). BPS displays endocrine-disrupting behaviours similar to those of BPA and increases body weight, food intake and the hypothalamic expression of Agrp in vivo. However, the mechanisms behind this deleterious effect are unclear. Here, we report an increase in the mRNA level of Agrp at 4¬†h following BPS treatment in immortalized murine hypothalamic cell lines of embryonic and adult origin (mHypoE-41, mHypoA-59). BPS-induced changes in the expression of transcription factors and estrogen receptors that occurred concurrently with Agrp upregulation demonstrated similarities to BPA-induced changes, however, there were also changes that were unique to BPS. Specifically, while Chop, Atf3, Atf4, Atf6, Klf4, and Creb1 were upregulated and Gper1 was downregulated by both BPA and BPS, Esr1 mRNA levels were upregulated and Foxo1 and Stat3 levels remained unchanged by BPS. Finally, inhibition of GPER1 by G15 prevented BPS-mediated Agrp upregulation, independent of Atf3 and Klf4 upregulation. Overall, our results demonstrate the ability of BPS to increase Agrp mRNA expression through GPER1 signaling and to alter transcription factor expression in hypothalamic neurons, further elucidating the endocrine-disrupting potential of this alternative industrial chemical.","Agouti-Related Protein,Benzhydryl Compounds,GPER1 protein, mouse,Phenols,RNA, Messenger,Receptors, Estrogen,Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled,Sulfones,Transcription Factors,bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)sulfone,bisphenol A",,"Animals,Anxiety,Brain Stem,Depression,Mice,Norepinephrine,Stress, Psychological"

Magnesium lithospermate B (MLB), an active compound of Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen), has beneficial effects on insulin resistance and metabolic abnormalities in diet-induced obese rodents. Since exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemical Bisphenol A (BPA) during pregnancy mimics the effects of high fat diet-induced alterations of glucose and lipid metabolism in adult male offspring, the effects of daily MLB supplementation for 4‚Äâweeks on metabolic abnormalities in rats weaning from prenatal BPA-exposed dams were investigated. BPA-exposed rats developed obesity and adiposity concurrent with hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia, and elevation of circulating glucagon and free fatty acids. Increased hepatic fatty acid synthesis and decreased fatty acid Œ≤-oxidation, activation of adipocytic adipogenesis, maturation, and lipogenesis, as well as reduction of muscular glucose uptake were demonstrated in BPA-exposed rats. The aforementioned alterations were improved by MLB supplementation. Additionally, MLB displayed negative effects on glucocorticoid receptor action and inflammation, and promoted lipolysis and thermogenesis in the adipose tissues. In conclusion, our findings suggest that MLB may be a potential therapeutic compound against metabolic diseases, including maternal exposure-induced metabolic abnormalities.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Drugs, Chinese Herbal,Phenols,lithospermate B,bisphenol A","Anxiety,Depression,HPA-axis,Microbiome,Microbiota-gut-brain axis","Animals,Anxiety,Brain,Depression,Gastrointestinal Microbiome,Humans,Mental Health,Stress, Psychological"

We examined whether postnatal exposure to GBH affects developmental programming of the uterus with long-term consequences. Female Wistar pups received vehicle (control) or GBH (2¬†mg of glyphosate/kg/day) from postnatal day (PND) 1 to PND7, where the developing uterus is highly sensitive to endocrine disruption. Short-, mid- and long-term effects were evaluated on PND8, PND120 and PND600, respectively. GBH induced hyperplasia and epigenetic alterations in the uterus of neonatal females (PND8). DNA hypermethylation, enrichment of H3K9me3 and reductions of H3K27me3 at regulatory regions of the morphoregulatory gene Hoxa10 resulted in gene downregulation. In young adult females (PND120), GBH increased 17Œ≤-estradiol (E2) and decreased progesterone (P4) serum levels, altering estrous cyclicity. Aged females (PND600) exposed to GBH developed leiomyoma and pre-neoplastic glandular lesions in the uterus. Vaginal rhabdomyosarcoma and intrahepatic bile duct adenoma were also observed. In conclusion, neonatal exposure to GBH altered the expression and induced hypermethylation of the Hoxa10 gene in uterine tissue at early life, and increased E2/P4 ratio serum level at middle-age. We propose that epigenetic reprogramming of Hoxa10 in association with hormonal imbalance could be among the possible mechanisms underlying the long-term adverse effects detected in GBH-exposed rats.","Endocrine Disruptors,Herbicides,glyphosate,Glycine","Organotin compounds,Tributyltin,Vascular reactivity,eNOS","Animals,Aorta, Thoracic,Lipid Peroxidation,Male,Muscle, Smooth, Vascular,Myocytes, Smooth Muscle,NF-kappa B,Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II,Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III,Oxidative Stress,Phosphorylation,Rats, Wistar,Testosterone,Trialkyltin Compounds,Vasoconstriction"

It is considered an endocrine-disrupting chemical. Whether MTBE affects the development of Leydig cells in late puberty of males and its underlying mechanism remains unclear. Twenty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats (35 days old) were randomly allocated into four groups and were orally given MTBE (0, 300, 600, and 1200¬†mg/kg/day) from postnatal day (PND) 35-56. MTBE markedly reduced serum testosterone levels at 300¬†mg/kg and higher doses without altering the serum levels of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone. It mainly inhibited cell proliferation, induced mitochondrial autophagy and apoptosis, and indirectly stimulated Sertoli cells to secrete anti-M√ºllerian hormones, thereby significantly reducing the number of Leydig cells at 1200¬†mg/kg. MTBE also markedly down-regulated the expression of mature Leydig cell biomarker Cyp11a1 and Hsd3b1 and their proteins, while up-regulating the expression of immature Leydig cell biomarker Akr1c14 and its protein at 600¬†mg/kg and higher. MTBE significantly down-regulated the expression of cell cycle gene Ccnd1, antioxidant gene Gpx1, and anti-apoptotic gene Bcl2, while increasing pro-apoptotic gene Bax level at 1200¬†mg/kg. In vitro study further confirmed that MTBE can inhibit testosterone synthesis by inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, mitophagy, and apoptosis at 200 and 300¬†mM. In conclusion, exposure to MTBE compromises the development of Leydig cells in late puberty in male rats.","Methyl Ethers,methyl tert-butyl ether,Testosterone",,"Animals,Aorta,Blood Pressure,Cardiovascular System,Carotid Sinus,Heart Rate,Male,Medulla Oblongata,Norepinephrine,Pressoreceptors,Rats,Reflex,Renin,Stress, Psychological"

It is a substance with an endocrine-disrupting capacity, causing alterations in the reproductive, immunological, and neurological systems, among others, as well as metabolic alterations. Our study aimed to assess its clinical signs, and effects on the most relevant blood biochemical parameters, and to evaluate pituitary and gonadal histology after a chronic exposure of adult mice to different BPA doses (0.5, 2, 4, 50 and 100 ¬µg/kg BW/day) through their drinking water. The biochemical results showed that a marked significant reduction ( &lt; 0.05) was produced in the levels of serum glucose, hypoproteinaemia and hypoalbuminemia in the groups exposed to the highest doses, whereas in the group exposed to 50 ¬µg/kg BW/day the glucose and total protein levels dropped, and the animals exposed to 100 ¬µg/kg BW/day experienced a diminution in albumin levels. In the case of the group exposed to 50 ¬µg/kg BW/day, however, hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia were determined, and the blood parameters indicating kidney alterations such as urea and creatinine experienced a significant increase ( &lt; 0.05) with respect to the controls. Regarding the pituitary and gonads, none of the animals exposed presented histological alterations at the doses tested, giving similar images to those of the control group. These results suggest that continuous exposure to low BPA doses could trigger an inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis, which would result in a hypoglycaemic state, together with an induction of the enzymes responsible for lipidic synthesis, a mechanism by which the increase in the lipid and serum cholesterol levels could be explained. Likewise, the decline in the protein and albumin levels would be indicative of a possible hepatic alteration, and the increase in urea and creatinine would point to a possible renal perturbation, derived from continuous exposure to this xenobiotic. Based on our results, it could be said that chronic exposure to low BPA doses would not produce any clinical signs or histological pituitary-gonadal effects, but it could cause modifications in some blood biochemical parameters, that could initially indicate a possible hepatic and renal effect.'}","Creatinine,bisphenol A,Glucose,Urea,Albumins,Endocrine Disruptors",,"Animals,Apoptosis,Attention Deficit and Disruptive Behavior Disorders,Behavior, Animal,Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine System,Environmental Pollutants,Estrogens, Non-Steroidal,Female,Haplorhini,Humans,Maternal Exposure,Monoamine Oxidase,Nervous System,Phenols,Polychlorinated Biphenyls,Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins,Pregnancy,Propylthiouracil,Rats"
22447140,-122,Triptolide,Reproductive,Effect of triptolide on estradiol release from cultured rat granulosa cells.,"Triptolide, a major active component of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F (TWHF), is known to have multiple pharmacological activities. However, studies have also shown that triptolide is highly toxic to the reproductive system by disrupting normal androgen and estrogen signaling. In the present study, we investigated the effect of triptolide (5, 10, or 20 nM for 24 h) on estradiol production by rat granulosa cells. Triptolide inhibited basal and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG)- or 8-bromo-cAMP-stimulated estradiol production as revealed by RIA assay. Furthermore, the HCG-evoked increase in cellular cAMP content was also inhibited by triptolide, indicating that disruption of the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway may mediate the deleterious effects of triptolide on steroid hormone regulation. In addition, (3)H(2)O tests showed that aromatase activity was significantly inhibited by triptolide in granulosa cells. Western blot and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays further revealed that triptolide decreased protein and mRNA expression of aromatase in granulosa cells. Moreover, mRNA expression of luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) was induced by triptolide also using qRT-PCR method. In contrast, cell viability tests using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5- diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) method indicated that triptolide did not cause measurable cell death at doses that suppressed steroidogenesis. The reproductive toxicity of triptolide may be mainly caused by disruption of cAMP/PKA-mediated expression of estrogen synthesis enzymes, leading to reduced estradiol synthesis and reproductive dysfunction.","Diterpenes,Epoxy Compounds,Immunosuppressive Agents,Phenanthrenes,RNA, Messenger,Receptors, LH,triptolide,Estradiol,Cyclic AMP,Aromatase,Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases","apoptosis,bisphenol A,germ cell associations,testis morphology","Animals,Apoptosis,Benzhydryl Compounds,Cell Count,Endocrine Disruptors,Female,Humans,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred ICR,Paternal Exposure,Phenols,Pregnancy,Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects,Spermatogonia,Stem Cells,Testis"

While estrogen signaling is essential for normal postnatal prostate development, little is known about its prenatal role in control animals. We tested the hypothesis that estrogen signaling is needed for normal male prostatic bud patterning. Budding patterns were examined by scanning electron microscopy of urogenital sinus epithelium from wild-type mice, mice lacking estrogen receptor (ER)alpha, ERbeta, or both, and wild-type mice exposed to the antiestrogen ICI 182,780. Budding phenotypes did not detectably differ among any of these groups, strongly suggesting that estrogen signaling is not needed to establish the prototypical prostatic budding pattern seen in control males. This finding contributes to our understanding of the effects of low-level estrogen exposure on early prostate development. In utero exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) can greatly alter the pattern in which prostatic buds form and reduce their number. For several reasons, including a prior observation that inhibitory effects of TCDD on prostatic budding in rats depend heavily on the sex of adjacent fetuses, we tested the hypothesis that estrogen signaling is needed for TCDD to disrupt prostatic budding. However, budding did not detectably differ among wild-type mice, or mice lacking ERalpha, ERbeta, or both, that were exposed prenatally to TCDD (5 microg/kg on embryonic day 13.5). Nor did ICI 182,780 detectably affect the response to TCDD. These results strongly suggest that estrogen signaling is not needed for TCDD to inhibit prostatic epithelial budding.","Endocrine Disruptors,Estrogen Receptor alpha,Estrogen Receptor beta,Estrogens,Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins","Apoptosis,Bcl-2,Bisphenol A,Neurotoxicity,Nur77","Animals,Apoptosis,Benzhydryl Compounds,Cell Survival,Endocrine Disruptors,Orphan Nuclear Receptors,PC12 Cells,Phenols,Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2,Rats,Reactive Oxygen Species"
34678253,-122,di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate,Cardio-vascular,Effects and underlying cellular pathway involved in the impairment of the neurovascular unit following exposure of adult male mice to low doses of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate alone or in an environmental phthalate mixture.,"We have previously shown that adult male mice exposure to low doses of di (2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) impacts the blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and surrounding parenchyma in the medial preoptic area (mPOA), a key hypothalamic area involved in the male sexual behavior. BBB leakage was associated with a decrease in the endothelial tight junction accessory protein, zona occludens-1, and caveolae protein Cav-1, added to an inflammatory profile including glial activation accompanied by enhanced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase. As this failure of BBB functionality in the mPOA could participate, at least in part, in reported alteration of sexual behavior following DEHP exposure, we explored the cellular pathway connecting cerebral capillaries and neurons. Two-month-old C57BL/6J male mice were orally exposed for 6 weeks to DEHP alone (5 and 50¬†Œºg/kg/day) or to DEHP (5¬†Œºg/kg/day) in an environmental phthalate mixture. The presence of androgen receptor (AR) and estrogen receptor-Œ± (ERŒ±) were first evidenced in brain capillaries. Protein levels of AR but not of ERŒ± were reduced in cerebral capillaries after phthalate exposure. The amounts of basement membrane and cell-matrix interaction components were decreased, while matrix metalloprotease MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities were increased. Fluorojade¬Æ labelling suggested that exposure to phthalates also lead to a neurodegenerative process in the mPOA. Altogether, the data suggest that environmental exposure to endocrine disruptors such as phthalates, could alter AR/Cav-1 interaction, impacting a Cav-1/nitric oxide/MMP pathway. This would lead to disruption of the glio-neurovascular coupling which is essential to neuronal functioning.","Endocrine Disruptors,Phthalic Acids,phthalic acid,Diethylhexyl Phthalate","Bisphenol A,Environmental pollution,Intestinal barrier function,Intestinal permeability,Mice","Animals,Apoptosis,Benzhydryl Compounds,Colon,Hazardous Substances,Humans,Intestinal Mucosa,Intestines,Male,Mice,Mucin-2,Occludin,Permeability,Phenols"
35563302,-122,Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane,Adrenal,Impact of Prenatal and Postnatal Exposure to Endocrine Disrupter DDT on Adrenal Medulla Function.,"Epinephrine is the most abundant catecholamine hormone, produced by the nervous system and adrenal glands. Endocrine disruption of epinephrine synthesis, secretion and signaling is less studied than steroid and thyroid hormones. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is recognized as one of the most prominent environmental contaminants with a long half-life. It is a potent endocrine disrupter affecting sex steroid, mineralocorticoid, glucocorticoid and thyroid hormone production. Exposure to low doses of DDT is universal and begins in utero. Therefore, we studied adrenal medulla growth and function in male Wistar rats exposed to low doses of DDT during prenatal and postnatal development until puberty and adulthood, as well as rats exposed to DDT since the first day of postnatal development. All the exposed rats demonstrated lowered epinephrine blood levels, gradually reducing with age. DDT was found to inhibit the synthesis of tyrosine hydroxylase and affect the mitochondrial apparatus of epinephrine-producing cells during puberty and even after maturation. Low-dose exposure to DDT from birth resulted in more pronounced changes in adrenomedullary cells and a more profound decrease (up to 50%) in epinephrine secretion in adult rats. Prenatal onset of exposure demonstrated a mild effect on epinephrine-producing function (30% reduction), but was associated with lower rate of adrenal medulla growth during maturation and 25% smaller adrenal medullar size in adult rats. All subjects exposed to low doses of DDT failed to develop adaptive changes and restore proper epinephrine production. These results indicate a dysmorphogenetic effect of prenatal exposure and disruption of secretory function of adrenal chromaffin cells by postnatal exposure to DDT.","Endocrine Disruptors,DDT,Epinephrine",,"Animals,Apoptosis,Blood Glucose,Female,Food Coloring Agents,Homeostasis,Humans,Hyperinsulinism,Hyperplasia,Hypoglycemia,Imidazoles,Insulin,Insulin-Secreting Cells,Lipid Metabolism,Mice,Mice, Inbred BALB C,Oxidative Stress"

BPA is a well-known endocrine-disrupting chemical, and it was reported that BPA has an adverse effect on the nervous and immune systems. However, BPA-induced memory impairment and changes in neuroimmune biomarkers in the allergic asthmatic subject are not known yet. We aim to investigate the dietary exposure effect of BPA on brain function and biomarkers using allergic an asthmatic mouse model.

Memory function was determined by a novel object recognition test. Genes related to memory and immune markers in the hippocampus were investigated with the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. In this study, impaired novel object recognition occurred in BPA-exposed mice in the presence of an allergen. Moreover, upregulation of expression level of neuroimmune biomarkers such as N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, tumor necrosis factor-Œ±, ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule-1, cyclooxygenase-2, and heme oxygenase-1 in the hippocampus was observed in BPA-exposed allergic asthmatic mice. These findings show that BPA exposure can induce neuroinflammation and which triggers impairment of memory function in mice with allergic asthma.

33258555,-122,bisphenol A,Reproductive,The interference effects of bisphenol A on the synthesis of steroid hormones in human ovarian granulosa cells.,"Numerous studies have shown that endocrine-disrupting chemicals are one of the important pathogenic factors in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. Our previous study has revealed that bisphenol A (BPA) can cause steroid hormone imbalance, polycystic ovary, and estrus cycle disorder. In this study, we aimed to explore the effect of BPA, a typical environmental estrogen, on the synthesis of steroid hormones in human ovarian granulosa KGN cells. Exposure of KGN cells to BPA (0.5, 5, 50, and 500‚ÄâŒºg/L) resulted in the decrease of progesterone (P), estradiol (E2), and the ratio of estradiol to testosterone (E2/T). BPA affected the expression of genes related to steroid hormone synthesis in KGN cells, including the decreased expression of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, ferredoxin, and ferredoxin reductase genes during progesterone synthesis; upregulating the expression of cytochrome p450 oxidoreductase gene associated with E2 and T synthesis; and the downregulated cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily A member 1 and cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily B member 1 in E2 degradation. BPA also reduced the expression of stimulatory G proteins (GS) in follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR)/GS/adenylate cyclase (AC) signaling pathway. In summary, our research has demonstrated that environment-relevant level of BPA exposure leads to steroid hormone synthesis disorder in human ovarian granulosa cells, which might cause the reduction of gene expression in hormone synthesis and the suppression of the FSHR/GS/AC signaling pathway.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Phenols,Testosterone,Progesterone,Estradiol,bisphenol A","Cadmium (Cd),apoptosis,oxidative stress,pubertal male rats,reproductive toxicity","Animals,Apoptosis,Cadmium,Caspases,Genes, bcl-2,Male,RNA, Messenger,Random Allocation,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Reproduction,Spermatozoa,Testis,Testosterone"

Pubertal male ICR mice were orally exposed to DEHP (0.18, 1.8, 18 and 180\xa0mg/kg/d) for 3\xa0weeks. In Open field test, DEHP significantly increased the time in central area staying and decreased the total distance and clockwise (CW) rotation of P-normal and P-T2DM mice. Morris water maze showed that DEHP significantly increased the latency in locating platform and decreased the original platform quadrant and residence time in target quadrant of P-normal and P-T2DM mice. Transcriptome analysis results revealed the effects of DEHP exposure on neural signaling pathway including biogenic amines neurotransmitters, nerve receptors, neurobiological processes, etc. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blotting results showed that DEHP significantly decreased the contents of 5-HT, cAMP, GABA and Ca, the levels of CREB, phosphorylation of PKA, ERK1/2 and CREB, increased the levels of CaM and phosphorylation of CaMKII in P-normal and P-T2DM mice.

DBP can be released into the environment and potentially disrupting mammalian male reproductive endocrine system. However, the potencies of DBP and MBP to inhibit Leydig cell steroidogenesis and their possible mechanisms are not clear. Immature Leydig cells isolated from rats were cultured with 0.05-50‚ÄâŒºM DBP or MBP for 3‚Äâh in combination with testosterone synthesis regulator or intermediate. The concentrations of 5Œ±-androstanediol and testosterone in the media were measured, and the mRNA levels of the androgen biosynthetic genes were detected by qPCR. The direct actions of DBP or MBP on CYP11A1, CYP17A1, SRD5A1, and AKR1C14 activities were measured. MBP inhibited androgen production by the immature Leydig cell at as low as 50‚ÄânM, while 50‚ÄâŒºM was required for DBP to suppress its androgen production. MBP mainly downregulated Cyp11a1 and Hsd3b1 expression levels at 50‚ÄânM. However, 50‚ÄâŒºM DBP downregulated Star, Hsd3b1, and Hsd17b3 expression levels and directly inhibited CYP11A1 and CYP17A1 activities. In conclusion, DBP is metabolized to more potent inhibitor MBP that downregulated the expression levels of some androgen biosynthetic enzymes.","Androgens,Phthalic Acids,RNA, Messenger,Steroids,Dibutyl Phthalate,Testosterone,CYP17A1 protein, rat,Steroid 17-alpha-Hydroxylase,Cholesterol Side-Chain Cleavage Enzyme,3-Oxo-5-alpha-Steroid 4-Dehydrogenase,monobutyl phthalate",,"Animals,Apoptosis,Endocrine System,Humans,Methylmercury Compounds,Nervous System,Neurons"

Here, the pregnant mice were treated with corn oil (control) or DBP at three different doses by oral gavage during gestational days (GD) 12.5-21.5. The results showed that in utero exposure to DBP induced a significant increase of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) content in serum, as well as activation and proliferation of astrocytes in the hypothalamus of offspring male mice on postnatal day (PND) 22. However, in in vitro study, mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP), the metabolite of DBP, could not increase the release of GnRH after GnRH neurons were exposed to MBP. Further studies identified that MBP-mediated activation and proliferation of astrocytes resulted in increased secretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which might be responsible for the increased release of GnRH from GnRH neurons. This study highlights the neuroendocrine toxicity of current plasticizer DBP exposure, laying the foundation for identifying potential molecular targets for related diseases.","Endocrine Disruptors,Phthalic Acids,Dibutyl Phthalate,Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone,Dinoprostone,monobutyl phthalate","Dimethyl phthalate,Immunotoxicity,Phthalate ester,Transcriptomics","Animals,Apoptosis,Esters,Necrosis,Oxidative Stress,Phthalic Acids,Rats"

The accumulation of BPA has been proved that produce various toxic effects both on human and animals. However, the strategies to reduce the damage of BPA on the body and related mechanisms remain to be studied. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), as a powerful antioxidant, is ubiquitous in many eukaryotic cells, which can improve the integrity of lysosomal membrane, lysosomal degradation function and promote autophagy. Here, we examined the ability of CoQ10 to alleviate oxidative stress and apoptosis in BPA-induced damages in C2C12 cells, and how to alleviate it. Our results showed that BPA treatment significantly reduced cell viability, increased the number of cell apoptosis and ROS production, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and inhibited the gene expression of mitochondria biogenesis. Moreover, we demonstrated that exposure to BPA increased expression levels of autophagy protein (LC3-II, p62), inhibited autophagy flux, and disrupted the acidic pH environment of lysosomes. Importantly, CoQ10 supplementation effectively restored these abnormalities caused by BPA. CoQ10 significantly decreased the apoptotic incidence and ROS levels, improved mitochondrial membrane potential. Moreover, CoQ10 improved lysosome function and enhanced autophagy flux. Taken together, our results indicate that CoQ10 supplementation is a feasible and effective way to promote the level of autophagy by improving lysosomal function, thereby reducing the apoptosis caused by BPA accumulation. This study aims to provide evidence for the role of CoQ10 in repairing BPA-induced cell damage in clinical practice.","Antioxidants,Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Phenols,Ubiquinone,coenzyme Q10,bisphenol A","Apoptosis,Leydig cell development,MTBE,Mitophagy,Proliferation,Steroidogenesis","Animals,Apoptosis,Leydig Cells,Male,Methyl Ethers,Mitophagy,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Testosterone"

However, the mechanisms of action underlying IAA toxicity in ovarian follicles remain unclear. Thus, we determined whether IAA alters gene expression in ovarian follicles in mice. Adult female mice were dosed with water or IAA (10 or 500 mg/L) in the water for 35-40 days. Antral follicles were collected for RNA-sequencing analysis and sera were collected to measure estradiol. RNA-sequencing analysis identified 1063 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the 10 and 500 mg/L IAA groups (false discovery rate FDR < 0.1), respectively, compared to controls. Gene Ontology Enrichment analysis showed that DEGs were involved with RNA processing and regulation of angiogenesis (10 mg/L) and the cell cycle and cell division (500 mg/L). Pathway Enrichment analysis showed that DEGs were involved in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase B (PI3K-Akt), gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), estrogen, and insulin signaling pathways (10 mg/L). Pathway Enrichment analysis showed that DEGs were involved in the oocyte meiosis, GnRH, and oxytocin signaling pathways (500 mg/L). RNA-sequencing analysis identified 809 DEGs when comparing the 500 and 10 mg/L IAA groups (FDR < 0.1). DEGs were related to ribosome, translation, mRNA processing, oxidative phosphorylation, chromosome, cell cycle, cell division, protein folding, and the oxytocin signaling pathway. Moreover, IAA exposure significantly decreased estradiol levels (500 mg/L) compared to control. This study identified key candidate genes and pathways involved in IAA toxicity and can help to further understand the molecular mechanisms of IAA toxicity in ovarian follicles.","Water,Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone,Estradiol,Oxytocin,RNA,Iodoacetic Acid","Aquaculture,Dibutyl phthalate,Probiotics,Streptomyces S073,Vibiro parahaemolyticus","Animals,Aquaculture,Dibutyl Phthalate,Probiotics,Streptomyces,Vibrio"

Flumethrin is a pyrethroid that is used against ectoparasites in many animals. The goal of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxic, apoptotic, genotoxic, and estrogenic effects of flumethrin on the mammalian breast cancer cell line (MCF-7). Compared with control groups, a dose-dependent decrease was observed in cell viability at concentrations of 100 ¬µM and higher. The cytotoxic and apoptotic effects detected by LDH assay and AO/EtBr staining increased significantly at a concentration of 1000 ¬µM. The expression of BCL2, which is an anti-apoptotic gene, significantly decreased, whereas BAX, TP53, and P21 expression significantly increased. The results of a comet assay indicated that flumethrin significantly changed tail length, tail % DNA, tail moment, and Olive tail moment in concentrations above 1 and 10 ¬µM. In addition, a 0.1 ¬µM concentration of flumethrin affected ERŒ± receptor mediated cell proliferation and increased transcription of estrogen-responsive pS2 (TFF1) and progesterone receptor (PGR) genes. As a result, flumethrin-induced apoptosis and cytotoxicity at a high concentration, while induced genotoxicity even at lower concentrations.

Compared with control group, TMX administration induced reductions in testicular levels of glutathione and antioxidant activities of SOD and CAT. In addition, TMX-exposed rats showed lower serum testosterone hormonal levels as well as higher malondialdehyde and nitric acid levels were detected in TMX-administered rats. On a molecular basis, mRNA expressions of StAR, CYP17a, 3Œ≤-HSD, SR-B1, and P450scc genes were significantly down-regulated in TMX group, whereas the expression of LHR and aromatase genes was up-regulated. Moreover, TMX-induced testicular damage was confirmed by histopathological screening. Importantly, however, the administration of either costus roots or SM significantly alleviated all aforementioned TMX-induced changes, indicating the effective antioxidant activities of these plant products.

Bromelain is a mixture of different thiol endopeptidases and other components with many uses as a natural anti-inflammatory enzyme. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of bromelain on male reproductive failure induced by BPA. A total of 60 healthy adult male mice were randomly divided into six groups (n¬†=¬†6), including control, bromelain (70‚Äâmg/kg), BPA (5 and 600‚Äâmg/kg), and BPA (5 and 600‚Äâmg/kg)‚Äâ+‚Äâbromelain.

Then, the epididymis and testes were removed to evaluate sperm parameters, oxidative stress markers, serum levels of testosterone concentrations, and oestrogen receptors expression. The BPA significantly (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05) decreased sperm count, motility, viability, and normal sperm morphology, as well as testosterone levels, oestrogen receptors alpha (ERŒ±) and beta (ERŒ≤), GPx, CAT, and SOD activity than control.

Perinatal development is a critical window for altered, lifelong health trajectory, and evidence supports the role of perinatal programming in chronic metabolic diseases. To examine the impact of diet and bisphenol A (BPA) on the developmental trajectory of NAFLD in offspring, we exposed dams from pre-gestation through lactation to a human-relevant dose of oral BPA coupled with intake of high fat Western or Mediterranean-style diets. We assessed hepatic steatosis by quantifying hepatic triglycerides (TGs) and metabolic health by measuring body weight, relative organ weights, and serum hormone levels in dams and offspring at postnatal day 10 (PND10) and 10-months of age. In dams, consumption of the Western or Mediterranean diet increased hepatic TGs 1.7-2.4-fold, independent of BPA intake. Among offspring, both perinatal diet and BPA exposure had a greater impact on metabolic outcomes than on hepatic steatosis. At PND10, serum leptin levels were elevated 2.6-4.8-fold in pups exposed to the Mediterranean diet, with a trend for sex-specific effects on body and organ weights. At 10-months, sex-specific increases in organ weight and hormone levels were observed in mice perinatally exposed to Western¬†+¬†BPA or Mediterranean¬†+¬†BPA. These findings suggest lifestage-specific interaction of perinatal exposures to experimental diets and BPA on offspring metabolic health without effects on NAFLD later in life. Importantly, alterations in dam phenotype by diet and BPA exposure appear to impact offspring health trajectory, emphasizing the need to define dam diet in assessing effects of environmental exposures on offspring health.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Phenols,bisphenol A","Male infertility,Male reproductive toxicity,Mechanism,Microcystin-LR","Animals,Arginine,Leucine,Male,Mammals,Marine Toxins,Microcystins"
34624416,-121,di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate,Neurological,Exposure to di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate reduces secretion of GDNF via interfering with estrogen pathway and downregulating ERK/c-fos signaling pathway in astrocytes.,"Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a typical endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) that can increase the risk of central nervous system disease. This study aimed to investigate the in vitro and in vivo effects of DEHP exposure on GDNF secretion and the underlying mechanisms. Pregnant Wistar rats were randomly assigned into four groups and administered 0, 30, 300, or 750¬†mg/kg DEHP daily by oral gavage. In addition, primary astrocytes were exposed to mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), the main metabolite of DEHP. Our results showed that DEHP exposure reduced GDNF levels and downregulated the ERK/c-fos signaling pathway in the cerebral cortex of male, but not female, offspring. Moreover, exogenous estrogen could overcome the decreased GDNF levels in astrocytes caused by MEHP exposure. MEHP also decreased p300 levels and downregulated the ERK/c-fos signaling pathway in primary astrocytes. Honokiol restored GDNF levels following MEHP exposure by activating the ERK/c-fos signaling pathway, while the inhibitor U0126 further reduced the GDNF levels. These results suggested that DEHP exposure could interfere with the normal effects of estrogen in the brain and downregulate the ERK/c-fos signaling pathway to decrease the GDNF secretion from astrocytes in the cerebral cortex.","Endocrine Disruptors,Estrogens,Gdnf protein, rat,Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor,Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos,Diethylhexyl Phthalate",,"Animals,Aromatase Inhibitors,Breast Neoplasms,Cell Cycle,Cell Line, Tumor,Checkpoint Kinase 2,Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4,Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6,Drug Resistance, Neoplasm,Female,Humans,MCF-7 Cells,Mice,MutL Proteins,Neoplasm Transplantation,Receptors, Estrogen"

At the time of mating, female C57BL/6\xa0dams were administered BPS (250\xa0nM) or vehicle control in the drinking water, and exposure continued during lactation. At 12-week of age, mesenteric arteries were excised from male and female offspring and assessed for responses to an endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine, ACh) and endothelium-independent (sodium nitroprusside, SNP) vasodilator. Endothelium-dependent dilation was measured in the presence or absence of L-NAME, an eNOS inhibitor. To further explore the role of NO and ER signaling, wire myography was used to assess ACh responses in aortic rings after acute exposure to BPS in the presence or absence of L-NAME or an ER antagonist.  Increased ACh dilation and increased sensitivity to Phe were observed in microvessels from BPS-exposed females, while no changes were observed in male offspring. Differences in ACh-induced dilation between control or BPS-exposed females were eliminated with L-NAME. Increased dilatory responses to ACh after acute BPS exposure were observed in aortic rings from female mice only, and differences were eliminated with inhibition of eNOS or inhibition of ER.  Prenatal BPS exposure leads to persistent changes in endothelium-dependent vascular function in a sex-specific manner that appears to be modulated by interaction of BPS with ER signaling.'}",,"cadmium,developmental disruptors,ecotoxicology of endocrine,epigenetic modification by DNA methylation,reptile vertebrates,sex determination,sexual testis and ovary development,transcriptional","Animals,Aromatase,Cadmium,DNA Methylation,Female,Gonads,Male,Turtles"

This study investigated the effects and possible mechanisms of TBT exposure on inducing human articular chondrocyte senescence in vitro at the human-relevant concentrations of 0.01-0.5¬†ŒºM and mouse articular cartilage aging in vivo at the doses of 5 and 25¬†Œºg/kg/day, which were 5 times lower than the established no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) and equal to NOAEL, respectively. TBT significantly increased the senescence-associated Œ≤-galactosidase activity and the protein expression levels of senescence markers p16, p53, and p21 in chondrocytes. TBT induced the protein phosphorylation of both p38 and JNK mitogen-activated protein kinases in which the JNK signaling was a main pathway to be involved in TBT-induced chondrocyte senescence. The phosphorylation of both ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and histone protein H2AX (termed Œ≥H2AX) was also significantly increased in TBT-treated chondrocytes. ATM inhibitor significantly inhibited the protein expression levels of Œ≥H2AX, phosphorylated¬†p38, phosphorylated¬†JNK, p16, p53, and p21. TBT significantly stimulated the mRNA expression of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)-related factors, including IL-1Œ≤, TGF-Œ≤, TNF-Œ±, ICAM-1, CCL2, and MMP13, and the protein expression of GATA4 and phosphorylated NF-Œ∫B-p65 in chondrocytes. Furthermore, TBT by oral gavage for 4¬†weeks in mice significantly enhanced the articular cartilage aging and abrasion. The protein expression of phosphorylated p38, phosphorylated JNK, GATA4, and phosphorylated NF-Œ∫B-p65, and the mRNA expression of SASP-related factors were enhanced in the mouse cartilages. These results suggest that TBT exposure can trigger human chondrocyte senescence in vitro and accelerating mouse articular cartilage aging in vivo.",,"gliosis,high-fat diet,hypothalamic inflammation,sexual dimorphism","Animals,Astrocytes,Energy Metabolism,Ependymoglial Cells,Female,Gliosis,Humans,Hypothalamus,Male,Microglia,Neuroglia,Neurons,Sex Factors"

This report confirms that Cd increased oxidative stress and apoptosis of germ and somatic cells and provoked testicular injury, as documented by biomolecular and histological alterations, i.e., CAT and SOD activity, the protein level of steroidogenic enzymes (StAR and 3Œ≤-HSD), and morphometric parameters. Additionally, it further documents the melatonin (MLT) coadministration produces affects in mitigating Cd-induced toxicity on adult rat testis, as demonstrated by the reduction of oxidative stress and apoptosis, with reversal of the observed histological changes; moreover, a role of MLT in partially restoring steroidogenic enzymes expression was evidenced. Importantly, the cytoarchitecture of testicular cells was perturbed by Cd exposure, as highlighted by impairment of the expression and localization of two cytoskeleton-associated proteins DAAM1 and PREP, which are involved in the germ cells' differentiation into spermatozoa, altering the normal spermatogenesis. Here, for the first time, we found that the co-treatment with MLT attenuated the Cd-induced toxicity on the testicular DAAM1 and PREP expression. The combined findings provide additional clues about a protective effect of MLT against Cd-induced testicular toxicity by acting on DAAM1 and PREP expression, encouraging further studies to prove its effectiveness in human health.","Antioxidants,Cytoskeletal Proteins,Daam1 protein, rat,Cadmium,Prolyl Oligopeptidases,Melatonin","17Œ±-ethinylestradiol (EE2),Embryotoxicity,Larval development,Mollusc,Parental exposure,Sydney rock oyster","Animals,Australia,Endocrine Disruptors,Estradiol Congeners,Ethinyl Estradiol,Female,Male,Ostreidae,Water Pollutants, Chemical"

BPA exposure dysregulates ASD-related genes in the hippocampus and neurological functions of offspring. However, whether prenatal BPA exposure has an impact on genes in the prefrontal cortex, another brain region highly implicated in ASD, and through what mechanisms have not been investigated. Here, we demonstrated that prenatal BPA exposure disrupts the transcriptome-interactome profiles of the prefrontal cortex of neonatal rats. Interestingly, the list of BPA-responsive genes was significantly enriched with known ASD candidate genes, as well as genes that were dysregulated in the postmortem brain tissues of ASD cases from multiple independent studies. Moreover, several differentially expressed genes in the offspring's prefrontal cortex were the targets of ASD-related transcription factors, including AR, ESR1, and RORA. The hypergeometric distribution analysis revealed that BPA may regulate the expression of such genes through these transcription factors in a sex-dependent manner. The molecular docking analysis of BPA and ASD-related transcription factors revealed novel potential targets of BPA, including RORA, SOX5, TCF4, and YY1. Our findings indicated that prenatal BPA exposure disrupts ASD-related genes in the offspring's prefrontal cortex and may increase the risk of ASD through sex-dependent molecular mechanisms, which should be investigated further.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Estrogen Receptor alpha,Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 1,Phenols,Receptors, Androgen,Transcription Factors,bisphenol A",,"Animals,Autonomic Nervous System,Chemoreceptor Cells,Child,Humans,Pressoreceptors,Sleep Apnea, Obstructive"
35026324,-120,Bisphenol AF,Reproductive,Bisphenol AF blocks Leydig cell regeneration from stem cells in male rats.,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant, mainly from the manufacture and use of plastics. The use of BPA is restricted, and its new analogs (including bisphenol AF, BPAF) are being produced to replace it. However, the effect of BPAF on the male reproductive system remains unclear. Here, we report the effect of BPAF on Leydig cell regeneration in rats. Leydig cells were eliminated by ethane dimethane sulfonate (EDS, i.p., 75¬†mg/kg) and the regeneration began 14 days after its treatment. We gavaged 0, 10, 100, and 200¬†mg/kg BPAF to rats on post-EDS day 7-28. BPAF significantly reduced serum testosterone and progesterone levels at ‚âß10¬†mg/kg. It markedly reduced serum levels of estradiol, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone at 100 and 200¬†mg/kg. BPAF significantly reduced Leydig cell number at 200¬†mg/kg. BPAF significantly down-regulated the expression of Cyp17a1 at doses of 10¬†mg/kg and higher and the expression of Insl3, Star, Hsd17b3, Hsd11b1 in Leydig cells at 100 and 200¬†mg/kg, while it induced a significant up-regulation of Fshr, Dhh, and Sox9 in Sertoli cells at 200¬†mg/kg. BPAF induced oxidative stress and reduced the level of SOD2 at 200¬†mg/kg. It induced apoptosis and autophagy by increasing the levels of BAX, LC3B, and BECLIN1 and lowering the levels of BCL2 and p62 at 100 and 200¬†mg/kg.

Estrogen is a primary hormonal regulator of skeletal growth and development; however, the impact of gestational BPA or BPS exposure on skeletal health of offspring remains relatively unknown. Here, adult female mice were randomized into three treatment groups: 200\xa0Œºg BPA/kg BW (BPA), 200\xa0Œºg BPS/kg BW (BPS) or control (CON). Animals were then further randomized to exercising (EX) or sedentary (SED) groups. Treatment continued through mating, gestation, and lactation. One male offspring from each dam (\xa0=\xa06-8/group) was assessed at 16\xa0weeks of age to evaluate effects of EDC exposure on the adult skeleton. Cortical geometry of the mid-diaphysis and trabecular microarchitecture of the distal femur were assessed via micro-CT. Biomechanical strength and mineral apposition rate of the femoral diaphysis were assessed via three-point bending and dynamic histomorphometry, respectively. Two-factor ANOVA or ANCOVA were used to determine the effects of maternal EX and BPA or BPS on trabecular and cortical bone outcomes. Maternal EX led to a significant decrease in body fat percentage and bone stiffness, independent of EDC exposure. Offspring exposed to BPA had significantly lower trabecular bone volume, trabecular number, connectivity density, cortical thickness, and greater trabecular spacing compared to BPS or CON animals. In conclusion, gestational BPA, but not BPS, exposure negatively impacted trabecular microarchitecture and cortical geometry in adult male offspring. If these findings translate to humans, this could have significant public health impacts on expecting women or those seeking to become pregnant.'}",,,"Animals,Avian Proteins,Canaries,Gene Expression Regulation,Hypothalamus,Opsins,Photic Stimulation,RNA Interference,RNA, Messenger,Thyrotropin, beta Subunit"

34245761,-120,di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate,"Cognitive, Neurological",Exercise prevents the impairment of learning and memory in prenatally phthalate-exposed male rats by improving the expression of plasticity-related proteins.,"Regular exercise has been identified to facilitate neuroplasticity that maximize functional outcome after brain injuries. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has emerged as a key facilitator of neuroplasticity after exercise. The activity-regulated cytoskeleton associated protein (Arc) is induced by BDNF and N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR), contributing to functional modification of neuroplasticity in the hippocampus. Meanwhile, early-life exposure to neuroendocrine disruptor di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP) is a risk factor for behavioral deficits, but the mechanisms responsible for DEHP-induced neurotoxicity are not well understood. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether hippocampal Arc expression is impaired by DEHP exposure and to examine the protective role of exercise in the prenatally DEHP-exposed male rats. Sprague Dawley dams were fed with vehicle or DEHP during gestation. The male offspring were trained to treadmill running for 5 weeks followed by examination of behavioral and biochemical outcomes. The results showed that DEHP-exposed rats exhibited impairment of spatial learning and memory as well as down-regulations of BDNF, NMDAR, Arc, and synaptophysin. Importantly, aerobic exercise during childhood-adolescence prevented the impairment of learning and memory by recovering the expressions of BDNF, NMDAR, Arc, and synaptophysin. These findings suggest that exercise may provide beneficial effects on ameliorating the impairment of neuroplasticity in the prenatally DEHP-exposed male rats at late adolescence.","Endocrine Disruptors,Phthalic Acids,phthalic acid",,"Animals,Basement Membrane,Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors,Blood-Testis Barrier,Male,Membrane Proteins,Mice,Occludin,Organ Size,Phosphoproteins,Seminiferous Tubules,Sertoli Cells,Spermatids,Spermatogenesis,Spermatogonia,Testis,Tight Junctions,Zonula Occludens-1 Protein,Zonula Occludens-2 Protein"

TCEP is also evidenced as endocrine disrupting chemicals and has potential adverse effects on metabolic diseases. In this study, we hypothesized that metabolic diseases are adverse outcomes of TCEP exposure. Adult ICR mice was daily treated with TCEP (20¬†mg/kg and 60¬†mg/kg, higher than expected level in people) by gavage administration for 9 weeks. The results demonstrate that TCEP promoted body weight gain, hypertriglyceridemia, and hepatic steatosis, consistent with upregulation of hepatic lipogenesis-related gene expression. Moreover, TCEP altered the levels of several hepatic metabolites, especially bile acids and downregulated bile acid synthesis pathways. Intriguingly, we found a marked downregulation of the bile acid nuclear reporter, FXR, in TCEP-exposed livers. Mechanistically, TCEP directly interacted with FXR at Lys335 and Lys336. Further studies in this work elucidate the mechanisms of long-term TCEP exposure on hepatic steatosis and obesity in mice via FXR-mediated lipid accumulation. Our results provide insight into the possibility of intermediate TCEP exposure in causing metabolic diseases.","Bile Acids and Salts,Flame Retardants,Lipids,Organophosphates,Phosphates,Phosphines,tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine","Classification and regression trees,Estrogenic activity,Intersex,Land cover,Land use,Pasma vitellogenin","Animals,Bays,Environmental Monitoring,Humans,Male,Retrospective Studies,Rivers,United States,Water Pollutants, Chemical"
32623865,-119,butylparaben,Cell damage,Effects of butylparaben on antioxidant enzyme activities and histopathological changes in rat tissues.,"Butyl p-hydroxybenzoic acid, also known as butylparaben (BP), is one of the most common parabens absorbed by the skin and gastrointestinal tract and metabolised in the liver and kidney. Recent in vivo and in vitro studies have raised concern that BP causes reproductive, development, and teratogenic toxicity. However, BP-induced oxidative stress and its relation to tissue damage has not been widely investigated before. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects of butyl 4-hydroxybenzoate on enzyme activities related to the pentose phosphate pathway and on glutathione-dependent enzymes such as glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6-PGD), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in kidney, liver, brain, and testis tissues. Male rats were randomly divided into four groups to orally receive corn oil (control) or 200, 400, or 800 mg/kg/day of BP for 14 days. Then we measured G6PD, GR, GST, 6-PGD, and GPx enzyme activities in these tissues and studied histopathological changes. BP treatment caused imbalance in antioxidant enzyme activities and tissue damage in the liver, kidney, brain, and testis. These findings are the first to show the degenerative role of BP on the cellular level. The observed impairment of equivalent homeostasis and antioxidant defence points to oxidative stress as a mechanism behind tissue damage caused by BP.","Antioxidants,Parabens,Preservatives, Pharmaceutical,Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase",,"Animals,Behavior, Animal,Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Estrous Cycle,Female,Male,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Paraventricular Hypothalamic Nucleus,Phenols,Pregnancy,Receptors, Estrogen,Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled,Social Behavior,Suprachiasmatic Nucleus,Vasopressins"

Here, we evaluate BPA's worsening effect on several hepatic maladaptive processes associated to high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity in mice. After 12 weeks HFD feeding, C57Bl/6J male mice were exposed daily to BPA (50 Œºg/kg per os) along with HFD for 3 weeks. Glucose tolerance and lipid metabolism were examined in serum and/or liver. Hepatic oxidative damage (reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, antioxidant enzymes), and mitochondrial respiratory capacity were evaluated. Moreover, liver damage progression and inflammatory/immune response were determined by histological and molecular analysis. BPA amplified HFD-induced alteration of key factors involved in glucose and lipid metabolism, liver triglycerides accumulation, and worsened mitochondrial dysfunction by increasing oxidative stress and reducing antioxidant defense. The exacerbation by BPA of hepatic immune-metabolic dysfunction induced by HFD was shown by increased toll-like receptor-4 and its downstream pathways (i.e., NF-kB and NLRP3 inflammasome) amplifying inflammatory cytokine transcription and promoting fibrosis progression.

34826089,-119,4-hydroxy benzophenone,"Pregnancy, Developmental",The association of prenatal exposure to benzophenones with gestational age and offspring size at birth.,"In recent decades, emerging environmental pollutants such as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have become a particular concern. This study examined the association of maternal exposure to benzophenones as one of the EDCs with gestational age and evaluated their effects on birth outcomes including birth weight, birth length, head circumference, and Ponderal Index. We assessed 166 pregnant mothers of the PERSIAN cohort population of Isfahan, Iran, in the 1st and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy and their infants at birth. Four common benzophenones (BPs) including 2,4-dihydroxy benzophenone (BP-1), 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy benzophenone (BP-3), 4-hydroxy benzophenone (4-OH-BP), and 2,2'-dihydroxy-4-methoxy benzophenone (BP-8) were measured in maternal urine samples. The median urinary concentrations of 4-OH-BP, BP-3, BP-1, and BP-8 in the 1st trimester were 6.62, 7.5, 4.39, and 1.32¬†¬µg/g creatinine and those in the 3rd trimester were 3.15, 16.98, 9.95, and 1.04¬†¬µg/g creatinine, respectively. BP-3 was the predominant metabolite in both trimesters. There was a significant correlation between BP-3, BP-1, and 4-OH-BP levels (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05) but not BP-8. BP-1 showed a significant positive association with gestational age (GA) in all infants in the 1st trimester, but a negative association was observed between BP-3 and BP-1 levels and GA in girls. Classification of infants' birth weight for different GAs represented that the majority of them were appropriate for GA. However, boys' weights were heavier than girls. Also, birth outcomes of preterm (<‚Äâ37¬†weeks) infants were noticeably lower than term infants (37-42¬†weeks). This study demonstrated that benzophenone derivatives especially BP-3 can affect the duration of pregnancy and consequently fetal growth in the early and late stages of pregnancy. This is more pronounced in girls; however, more investigations in a different population are needed to prove the results. Therefore, the application of these compounds as a UV protector requires precise regulation to reduce exposure, especially in pregnant women.","Benzophenones,Endocrine Disruptors,Creatinine",,"Animals,Behavior, Animal,Blood Proteins,Body Weight,Chemotaxis, Leukocyte,Cold Temperature,Cytotoxicity, Immunologic,Electrolytes,Female,Hot Temperature,Housing, Animal,Killer Cells, Natural,Lymphocyte Activation,Male,Neutrophils,Social Behavior,Social Dominance,Stress, Psychological,Swine,Transportation,Weight Loss"

The present study was aimed to test the effect of in utero exposure of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) on Leydig cell steroidogenesis in F1 male offspring's. Pregnant dams were oral gavaged with different doses (1, 10, and 100‚Äâmg/kg/day) of DEHP or olive oil during gestational Day 9-21. Serum testosterone (T) and estradiol (E2) levels were significantly reduced in male offspring at 60 days of age. Our results also demonstrate a coordinate, dose-dependent disruption of genes involved in steroidogenesis. The gene expression of StAR, Cyp11a1, 3Œ≤-HSD, 17Œ≤-HSD, 5Œ±-reductase and cytochrome P450 19a1 (or) aromatase (Cyp-19) were significantly decreased. The transcription factors like steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) and specific protein-1 (Sp-1) showed a significant decrease in 10 and 100‚Äâmg DEHP treatment group. DNA methylation analysis using bisulfite specific-methylation PCR shows hypermethylation in the SF-1 and Sp-1 promoter regions. Further to determine whether the DEHP-induced methylation changes were associated with increased DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt) levels, we measured the expression levels of Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, Dnmt1, and Dnmt3l using real-time PCR and Western blot method. The mRNA and protein expressions of Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, and Dnmt1 were stimulated in 10 and 100‚Äâmg DEHP treatment groups, whereas no significant change was seen in Dnmt3l expression, suggesting that increased Dnmt3a/b, Dnmt1 may cause DNA hypermethylation in testicular Leydig cells. Overall, these data suggest that gestational exposure to DEHP affects adult testicular function via altered methylation patterns.","Environmental Pollutants,Testosterone,Estradiol,Diethylhexyl Phthalate",,"Animals,Behavior, Animal,Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein,Environment,Exploratory Behavior,Genotype,Inhibition, Psychological,Maze Learning,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Knockout,Motor Activity,RNA, Messenger,Reaction Time,Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction,Sex Characteristics,Stress, Physiological,Time Factors"

Parabens are EDCs that are used as antibacterial preservatives in cosmetics, personal care products (PCPs), medicines, and food. We used ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to quantitatively detect methyl-, ethyl-, butyl-, and propylparaben (PP) concentrations in urine samples from 74 women of childbearing age. Balb/c mice were subcutaneously injected with 100‚Äâmg/kg/day of PP for 21 consecutive days or 100 or 1,000‚Äâmg/kg/day of PP during superovulation. Various concentrations of PP (ranging from 1 to 1,000‚ÄânM) were added to a human ovarian granulosa tumor-derived cell line (KGN) culture for 24‚Äâh. The urinary paraben concentrations of women who used cosmetics and other PCPs within 48‚Äâh prior to sample collection were significantly elevated, and the PP concentration was significantly positively correlated with the basal estradiol concentration. After PP injection, the mouse serum estradiol concentrations were significantly increased, estrus cycles were disordered, corpus luteum number was reduced, and number of oocytes retrieved was significantly reduced. In in vitro experiments, PP treatment increased estradiol synthesis and the expression levels of aromatase enzyme (CYP19A1) and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein. This study demonstrates the adverse effects of PP on ovarian estradiol secretion and ovulation, further evaluates the safety of PP as a preservative, and provides guidance for the use of PCPs and cosmetics by women of childbearing age.","Endocrine Disruptors,Parabens,Preservatives, Pharmaceutical,propylparaben","ALAN,Glucocorticoid,Hormones,Light pollution,Melatonin,Metabolism,Sleep,Stress,Thyroid,Urban ecology","Animals,Behavior, Animal,Darkness,Endocrine System,Genetic Fitness,Hormones,Light,Lighting,Vertebrates"

The aim of this study was to evaluate the toxic effects of TBT on the testes of adult albino rats and the possible role of omega-3. Forty two adult male albino rats were divided into five groups; control group (Group I) and four experimental groups: omega-3 treated group, TBT treated group, TBT & omega-3 treated group and follow up group. At the end of the study, the rats were subjected to biochemical, histological, immunohistochemical staining for Ki-67 and seminal examinations. Our results clarfied that TBT induced a significant decrease in testosterone, FSH, LH and serum glutathione peroxidase levels and a significant increase in the serum Malondialdehyde as compared to the control group. Tributyltin induced disorganization and shrinkage of seminiferous tubules, apoptosis, cellular damage and marked reduction in the germinal epithelium. A significant decrease in the cell proliferation and arrested spermatogenesis were also detected. Seminal analysis of TBT group showed a significant affection of all parameters as compared to other groups. Omega-3 ameliorated all of these hazardous effects. Follow up group still showed toxic effects. In conclusion, TBT has a toxic effect on the testis. Increased testicular oxidative stress, cellular damage and arrest of spermatogenesis with attenuation in antioxidant defenses are all contributing factors. Omega-3 can protect against TBT induced reproductive toxicity.","Fatty Acids, Omega-3,Protective Agents,Trialkyltin Compounds,Testosterone,tributyltin,Malondialdehyde,Luteinizing Hormone,Follicle Stimulating Hormone,Glutathione Peroxidase","anxiety,learning,maternal behavior,memory,reproductive experience,stress","Animals,Behavior, Animal,Female,Hippocampus,Maternal Behavior,Maternal Deprivation,Maze Learning,Memory,Mothers,Neuronal Plasticity,Postpartum Period,Rats, Wistar,Stress, Psychological,Weaning"

34270681,-118,bisphenol A,Cell damage,Comparing effects and action mechanisms of BPA and BPS on HTR-8/SVneo placental cells‚Ä†.,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is one of the most investigated compound as a suspected endocrine disrupting chemical. It has been found at nM concentrations in the maternal serum, cord serum, and amniotic fluid and also permeates placental tissues. Attempts are being made to replace BPA with the analog Bisphenol S (BPS). Also BPS was found in maternal and umbilical cord serum, and urine samples from a large population of pregnant women. A few studies investigated BPA impact on the placentation process, and even less are available for BPS. This work aimed to elucidate and compare the effects of BPA and BPS on physiological functions of HTR-8/SVneo cells, derived from extravillous trophoblast of first-trimester pregnancy. Proliferation and migration ability of trophoblast cells were assessed in vitro after exposure to BPA or BPS (10-13-10-3¬†M). Further, induction of the inflammatory response by the bisphenols was studied. To provide insight into the molecular pathways implicated in the responses, experiments were carried out in the presence or absence of tamoxifen as estrogen receptors (ERs) blocker, and U0126 as ERK1/2 phosphorylation inhibitor. Data indicate that BPA significantly affects both proliferation and migration of HTR-8/SVneo cells, through ER and ERK1/2 mediated processes. Differently, BPS only acts on proliferation, again through ER and ERK1/2 mediated processes. BPS, but not BPA, induces secretion of interleukins 6 and 8. Such effect is inhibited by blocking ERK1/2 phosphorylation.

It has been found at nM concentrations in the maternal serum, cord serum, and amniotic fluid and also permeates placental tissues. Attempts are being made to replace BPA with the analog Bisphenol S (BPS). Also BPS was found in maternal and umbilical cord serum, and urine samples from a large population of pregnant women. A few studies investigated BPA impact on the placentation process, and even less are available for BPS. This work aimed to elucidate and compare the effects of BPA and BPS on physiological functions of HTR-8/SVneo cells, derived from extravillous trophoblast of first-trimester pregnancy. Proliferation and migration ability of trophoblast cells were assessed in vitro after exposure to BPA or BPS (10-13-10-3¬†M). Further, induction of the inflammatory response by the bisphenols was studied. To provide insight into the molecular pathways implicated in the responses, experiments were carried out in the presence or absence of tamoxifen as estrogen receptors (ERs) blocker, and U0126 as ERK1/2 phosphorylation inhibitor. Data indicate that BPA significantly affects both proliferation and migration of HTR-8/SVneo cells, through ER and ERK1/2 mediated processes. Differently, BPS only acts on proliferation, again through ER and ERK1/2 mediated processes. BPS, but not BPA, induces secretion of interleukins 6 and 8. Such effect is inhibited by blocking ERK1/2 phosphorylation. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first data showing that BPS affects trophoblast functions through ER/MAPK modulation.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Phenols,Sulfones,bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)sulfone,bisphenol A",,"Animals,Benzhydryl Compounds,Breast,Breast Feeding,Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Exposure,Female,Humans,Lactation,Mammary Glands, Animal,Pesticides,Phenols,Phthalic Acids,Time Factors"

The Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) and restricted cubic spline (RCS) models showed a U-shaped dose-response relationship between bisphenol A (BPA) and free triiodothyronine (FT3) (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01) as well as BPS and FT4 (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05). Nonlinear relationships were also observed between the bisphenol mixture and FT3. Overall, maternal bisphenol exposure affected thyroid hormone levels during pregnancy.

The aim of this study was to determine whether nonylphenol (NP) exposure can induce gastric inflammation and whether its mechanism was related to NF-Œ∫B/NLRP3 signaling pathway. In vivo, male SD rats were randomly divided into 4 groups (12 rats/group): control group (corn oil), NP low (0.4¬†mg/kg), medium (4¬†mg/kg), and high (40¬†mg/kg) dose groups. After 33 weeks of NP chronic exposure, it was found pathological changes in gastric tissues, increase the release of inflammatory factors, and effects expressions of genes related to the NF-Œ∫B/NLRP3 signaling pathway. In vitro, the GES-1 cell experiments, which included four groups: control (0¬†¬µmol/L NP), L (2.5¬†¬µmol/L NP), M (40¬†¬µmol/L NP), and H (60¬†¬µmol/L NP), confirmed that NP increased the release of inflammatory factors in the cells, and up-regulated the expression of proteins related to NF-Œ∫B/NLRP3 signaling pathway. Furthermore, when pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate ammonium (PDTC) blocked the NF-Œ∫B signaling pathway, it was found that the expression of related proteins in the NF-Œ∫B/NLRP3 signaling pathway was decreased, and the release of inflammatory factors in GES-1 cells caused by NP was also attenuated. The results of this study indicated that NP can induce inflammation in the stomach in vivo and in vitro, and its mechanism was related to the NF-Œ∫B/NLRP3 signaling pathway. These findings provided a new perspective on the mechanism of inflammatory response induced by exposure to environmental endocrine disruptors. Also, these findings indicated that therapeutic strategies for the NF-Œ∫B/NLRP3 signaling pathway may be new methods to treat inflammatory diseases.","Ammonium Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Inflammasomes,NF-kappa B,NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein,Nlrp3 protein, rat,Phenols,nonylphenol,Corn Oil","bisphenol A,endocrine-disrupting chemicals,human ovarian granulosa cells,steroid hormones","Animals,Benzhydryl Compounds,Cell Culture Techniques,Cell Proliferation,Cell Survival,Dose-Response Relationship, Drug,Down-Regulation,Endocrine Disruptors,Estradiol,Female,Gene Expression,Granulosa Cells,Humans,Phenols,Progesterone,Testosterone,Up-Regulation"
25486513,-118,endosulfan,Reproductive,Neonatal exposure to low doses of endosulfan induces implantation failure and disrupts uterine functional differentiation at the pre-implantation period in rats.,"We investigated whether neonatal exposure to low doses of endosulfan affects fertility and uterine functional differentiation at pre-implantation in rats. Newborn female rats received the vehicle, 0.2‚Äâ¬µg/kg/d of diethylstilbestrol (DES), 6‚Äâ¬µg/kg/d of endosulfan (Endo6) or 600‚Äâ¬µg/kg/d of endosulfan (Endo600) on postnatal days (PND) 1, 3, 5, and 7. On PND90, the rats were mated to evaluate their reproductive performance on gestational day (GD) 19 and their ovarian steroid serum levels, endometrial proliferation and implantation-associated proteins on GD5. DES and endosulfan decreased the pregnancy rate and the number of implantation sites. On GD5, DES and endosulfan did not change the serum levels of 17Œ≤-estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P); the endometrial proliferation decreased, which was associated with silencing of Hoxa10 in the Endo600-treated rats. Both doses of endosulfan increased the progesterone receptor (PR) expression, whereas the higher dose led additionally to an increase in estrogen receptor alpha (ERŒ±). In the Endo600-treated rats, the down-regulation of Hoxa10 was associated with a deregulation of the steroid receptor coregulators. Alterations in endometrial proliferation and the endocrine pathway of Hoxa10/steroid receptors/coregulators might be the mechanism of endosulfan-induced implantation failure.","Carcinogens,Insecticides,Steroids,Diethylstilbestrol,Endosulfan","BPA,BPAF,In vitro maturation,MAD2,Oocyte","Animals,Benzhydryl Compounds,Cell Cycle Checkpoints,Cells, Cultured,Cytoplasm,Dose-Response Relationship, Drug,Endocrine Disruptors,Estrogens, Non-Steroidal,Female,Mad2 Proteins,Mice, Inbred ICR,Microscopy, Confocal,Oocytes,Phenols,Polar Bodies,Spindle Apparatus,Time Factors,Tubulin"
34606965,-118,Methylparaben,Immune,Methylparaben-induced regulation of estrogenic signaling in human neutrophils.,"Parabens, including the most common methylparaben (MeP), are popular preservatives, which possess estrogenic activity. The aims of this study were to assess the impact of MeP on estrogen receptors (ERs) and/or NF-Œ∫B-dependent generation of IL-8 and production of nitric oxide (NO), and also to verify the hypothesis about the crosstalk of ERs with NF-Œ∫B in xenoestrogen-exposed neutrophils. Human neutrophils were incubated for 20-h with MeP (0.06¬†ŒºM) and/or ER antagonist (1¬†ŒºM) and/or NF-Œ∫B inhibitor (100¬†ŒºM). After the isolation of cell lysates and cytoplasmic and nuclear fraction, the expression of ERŒ±, ERŒ≤, p-IKKŒ±/Œ≤, p65 NF-Œ∫B, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was measured by Western blot analysis, The concentration of NO was evaluated by Griess reaction, and that of IL-8 was measured by ELISA. The results showed that MeP modulated the expression of ERŒ±, but not ERŒ≤. Exposure to paraben activated iKKŒ±/Œ≤-dependent NF-Œ∫B pathway, but translocation of p65 NF-Œ∫B into the cell nucleus was inhibited by ERs. MeP also decreased the iNOS-dependent production of NO, but did not influence the secretion of IL-8 by neutrophils. The study indicates that MeP may affect the functioning of human neutrophils by modulating intracellular signal transduction pathways, including ERs and NF-Œ∫B pathway.","CXCL8 protein, human,Estrogens,Interleukin-8,NF-kappa B,Parabens,Receptors, Estrogen,Nitric Oxide,methylparaben",,"Animals,Benzhydryl Compounds,Cell Differentiation,Female,Leydig Cells,Male,Maternal Exposure,Phenols,Placenta,Pregnancy,Rabbits,Testis,Testosterone"
32798586,-118,butylparaben,Thyroid,Effects of butylparaben exposure on thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and type 1 iodothyronine deiodinase (D1) in female Wistar rats.,"Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have been considered as one of the major contributors of growing burden of thyroid disorders across the globe, and most of these chemicals have the potential to disrupt thyroid hormones (THs) synthesis and other regulatory pathways of thyroid gland function. Butylparaben (BP), an established xenobiotic used as synthetic preservative, has not been thoroughly evaluated for its molecular mechanism of thyroid disrupting potential. We investigated the effects of BP on activity and gene expression of thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and type 1 iodothyronine deiodinase (D1) in female Wistar rats following subcutaneous exposure to BP at doses of 1, 5 and 10‚ÄØmg/kg BW/day (expressed as BP1, BP5 and BP10 respectively) for 7 and 21 days. The results showed that BP1 and BP5 significantly increased serum T3/T4 ratio and TSH level, while BP10 reduced the level of T4 significantly without any apparent consequences on TSH and T3 levels. TPO activity in thyroid was significantly increased (p‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ0.05) at BP1 and BP5, but BP10 treatment showed no effect like 17Œ≤-estradiol (E2). After 7 days of exposure, BP reduced D1 activity in kidney in a dose-dependent manner, while decrease in D1 activity was significant only after dosing with BP1 for 21 days (p‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ0.05). Moreover, 7 and 21 days of BP exposure caused significant fold increase of Tpo mRNA levels in thyroid. In kidney, BP down-regulated the Dio1 gene (encodes D1) expression after 7 days, but significant fold increase was observed following 21 days of treatment. In conclusion, the present study revealed that BP exposure altered the transcriptional expression and activity of TPO and D1, where TSH reinforced possible association with TPO activity.","Endocrine Disruptors,Parabens,Triiodothyronine,butylparaben,Thyrotropin,Iodide Peroxidase,Thyroxine","BPA,Cytoskeleton,Neuro-2a,Neurotoxicity,Synapses","Animals,Benzhydryl Compounds,Cell Line,Cell Survival,Cytoskeleton,Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Pollutants,Mice,Microtubule-Associated Proteins,Neuropeptides,Neurotoxicity Syndromes,Phenols,Plasticizers,Synapses,Synaptophysin,tau Proteins"
11518620,-118,endotoxin,Reproductive,Endotoxin induces delayed ovulation following endocrine aberration during the proestrous phase in Holstein heifers.,"The effect of endotoxin on follicular growth and on secretion of LH, estradiol-17beta, progesterone and cortisol during the proestrous phase in cattle was investigated. Holstein heifers were treated with PGF2alpha at 11-13 d after ovulation to induce luteolysis. At 42 hr after PGF2alpha treatment, heifers were administered either lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Escherichia coli, O111:B4, 5 microg/kg, n = 6) or saline (control; n = 6) by i.v. bolus injection. Ovarian structures were monitored daily by transrectal ultrasonography, and blood samples were collected at various times for hormonal analysis. The duration from PGF2alpha treatment to ovulation was significantly longer in the LPS group (8.0 +/- 1.3 d) than in the control group (4.2 +/- 0.2 d). LPS significantly reduced the pulse frequency of LH for 6 hr after the administration, and increased the mean concentration and pulse amplitude of LH from 3 to 6 hr after the administration. The plasma concentrations of progesterone and cortisol were transiently increased after LPS administration. The plasma concentration of estradiol-17beta was significantly decreased at 24 hr after LPS administration compared to that in the controls. Five of six LPS-treated heifers exhibited no preovulatory LH surge until 120 hr after PGF2alpha treatment and the remaining heifer exhibited the surge at 108 hr after PGF2alpha treatment, while the LH surge was observed at 54-78 hr after PGF2alpha treatment in control heifers. These results suggest that endotoxin disrupts progression of the proestrous phase of cattle, interrupting the preovulatory estradiol rise and thus delaying the LH surge and the subsequent ovulation.","Lipopolysaccharides,Progesterone,Estradiol,Luteinizing Hormone,Dinoprost,Hydrocortisone","Bisphenol A,Endocrine disrupting chemical,RORŒ≥t,Th17 cells,VDR,Vitamin D3","Animals,Benzhydryl Compounds,Cell Proliferation,Dose-Response Relationship, Drug,Estrogens, Non-Steroidal,Female,Interleukin-23,Interleukin-6,Male,Models, Animal,Phenols,Pregnancy,Th17 Cells,Vitamin D"

There is rising concern that repeated exposure to phthalates during pregnancy and lactation could have long-term effects on maternal and fetal health. We hypothesize that exposure to DEHP during the developmental windows might affect the expression of molecules that regulate uterine function and that this effect would be passed on to further generations. Rat dams were treated with olive oil (vehicle) or DEHP (100\xa0mg/kg b.wt./day) orally from gestational day 9 (GD 9) to the end of lactation (PND 21). F maternal DEHP exposure resulted in multigenerational (F and F) reproductive toxicity, as evidenced by an extended estrous cycle, decreased mating, fertility, and fecundity indices. Serum progesterone and estradiol levels were decreased and their cognate receptors (PR and ERŒ±) in the uterus were decreased in the DEHP-exposed offspring rats. Further analysis of the expression of estrogen and progesterone regulatory genes such as Hox a11, VEGF A, Ihh, LIFR, EP4, PTCH, NR2F2, BMP2, and Wnt4 were reduced in the uteri of adult F and F generation rats born from DEHP-exposed F dams. Decreased expression of these crucial proteins due to DEHP exposure may lead to defects in epithelial proliferation and secretion, uterine receptivity, and decidualization in the uteri of successive generations. This study showed that maternal DEHP exposure impairs the expression of molecules that regulate uterine function and this multigenerational effect is transmitted via maternal lineage.""}",,"environmental chemicals,estrogen,mammary epithelium,organotypic culture,proteomics","Animals,Benzhydryl Compounds,Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid,Cluster Analysis,Environmental Pollutants,Estrogens, Non-Steroidal,Female,Humans,Mammary Glands, Animal,Mass Spectrometry,Mice,Organoids,Phenols,Phthalic Acids,Polychlorinated Biphenyls,Proteome,Proteomics"

34134381,-118,bisphenol AF,"Cognitive, Neurological",Perinatal low-dose bisphenol AF exposure impairs synaptic plasticity and cognitive function of adult offspring in a sex-dependent manner.,"Bisphenol AF (BPAF), a kind of the ideal substitutes of Bisphenol A (BPA), has frequently been detected in environmental media and biological samples. Numerous studies have focused on the reproductive toxicity, cardiotoxicity and endocrine disrupting toxicity of BPAF. However, little evidence is available on neurodevelopmental toxicity of BPAF. Here, our study is to evaluate the effect of perinatal BPAF exposure (0, 0.34, 3.4 and 34 mg/kg body weight/day, correspond to Ctrl, low-, medium- and high-dose groups) on the cognitive function of adult mouse offspring. This study firstly found that perinatal BPAF exposure caused cognitive impairments of mouse offspring, in which male offspring was more sensitive than female offspring in low- and medium-dose BPAF groups. Furthermore, the dendritic arborization and complexity of hippocampal CA1 and DG neurons in male offspring were impaired in all BPAF groups, and these effects were only found in high-dose BPAF group for female offspring. The damage of BPAF to dendritic spines, and the structural basis of learning and memory, was found in male offspring but not in females. Correspondingly, perinatal BPAF exposure significantly downregulated the expressions of hippocampal PSD-95 and Synapsin-1 proteins, and male offspring was more vulnerable than female offspring. Meanwhile, we explored the alteration of hippocampal estrogen receptors (ERs) to explain the sex specific impairment of cognitive function in low- and medium-dose BPAF groups. The results showed that perinatal BPAF exposure significantly decreased the expression of ERŒ± in male offspring in a dose-dependent manner, but not in female offspring. In addition, we found that perinatal BPAF exposure can disordered the balance of oxidation and antioxidation in hippocampus of male offspring. In summary, perinatal low-dose bisphenol AF exposure impairs synaptic plasticity and cognitive function of adult offspring in a sex-dependent manner. The present results provide a pierce of potential mechanism of BPAF-caused neurodevelopmental toxicity.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Phenols,4,4'-hexafluorisopropylidene diphenol","Amygdala,Androgen,Bisphenol-A,Dopamine,Social behavior,Striatum","Animals,Benzhydryl Compounds,Corpus Striatum,Endocrine Disruptors,Female,Humans,Male,Mice,Phenols,Sex Characteristics,Social Behavior"

Pregnant rats were randomly divided into four groups: control (received vehicle); BPA group (received BPA at 50¬†mg/kg/day); DEHP group (received DEHP at 30¬†mg/kg/day); and combined exposure group (received both BPA at 50¬†mg/kg/day and DEHP at 30¬†mg/kg/day) during pregnancy and lactation by oral gavage. At the end of lactation, male offspring (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ6) were randomly grouped. The alterations in the brain histopathology, neurotransmitter levels and enzyme activities in the cerebrum region, oxidative stress markers, and apoptotic effects in the hippocampus region were determined at adulthood. The results showed that exposure to EDCs at early stages of life caused significant changes in lipid peroxidation, total GSH and neurotransmitter levels, and activities of neurotransmitter-related enzymes. Moreover, BPA and/or DEHP led to apoptosis and histopathologic alterations in the hippocampus. Therefore, we can suggest that changes in oxidant/antioxidant status, as well as in neurotransmitters and related enzymes, can be considered as the underlying neurotoxicity mechanisms of BPA and DEHP.

Endometrial decidualization is a critical event for embryo implantation. In this study, we aimed to explore the effects of EtP/PrP on endometrial decidualization. Pregnant mice were dosed daily by oral gavage with EtP at 0, 400, 800 and 1600‚Äâmg/kg or with PrP at 0, 625, 1250 and 2500‚Äâmg/kg from Day 1 of pregnancy until sacrifice. The results showed that the rate of pregnant mice with impaired embryo implantation, whose number of implantation sites was less than 7, was significantly increased after exposure to 1600‚Äâmg/kg EtP or 2500‚Äâmg/kg PrP. Further study found that the expression of endometrial decidualization markers HOXA10, MMP9 and PR was significantly downregulated in 1600‚Äâmg/kg EtP group and 2500‚Äâmg/kg PrP group. Notably, serum oestrogen and progesterone levels were significantly increased, whereas the expression of uterine oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor was decreased following 1600‚Äâmg/kg EtP or 2500‚Äâmg/kg PrP exposure.

It is able to modulate ryanodine-like calcium channels, which are widely found in the organism of insects and mammals. The objective of this research was to verify the possible reproductive effects of adult female Wistar rats exposure to cyantraniliprole. Animals (67 days old) were exposed to the chemical at doses of 10 or 150 mg/kg/day, orally, for 28 consecutive days (control animals received only the vehicle). Vaginal secretions were collected during the exposure period to assess the regularity of the estrous cycle; the liver, kidneys, pituitary gland, adrenal gland, uterus, and ovaries were collected and weighed; reproductive organs were assessed for histopathological evaluation and for biochemical markers of oxidative stress and progesterone plasma level was measured. Both doses caused negative changes in the morphology and redox system of the uterus and ovaries. Animals exposed to 10‚Äâmg/kg also exhibited higher level of plasma progesterone, elevated levels of lipid peroxidation in reproductive organs, increased superoxide dismutase activity in the uterus and glutathione peroxidase activity on the ovary, while the 150‚Äâmg/kg group exhibited an increment in estrous cycle length and diminished uterine glandular epithelium. Based on these results, we conclude that cyantraniliprole may have acted as an endocrine disruptor, and its effects are mediated by oxidative stress.","Endocrine Disruptors,Insecticides,Pyrazoles,ortho-Aminobenzoates,Progesterone,Oxidoreductases,Glutathione Transferase,Cholinesterases,cyantraniliprole","DNA methylation,Environmental chemical,Fertility,Reproductive health,Testis","Animals,Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Female,Male,Mice,Phenols,Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects,Testis"

Here we examined the effects of developmental exposure of rats to PCP on various aspects of brain development, male reproductive function, and adrenal function, all of which are under thyroid hormones regulation. PCP was administered to dams and their offspring via drinking water (6.6 mg l(-1)) during gestation and lactation. Tissue samples were obtained from dams, 3-week-old weanling pups, and 12-week-old pups. Gene expressions of thyroid hormone receptor beta1 and synapsin I, factors that promote brain growth, was increased in the cerebral cortex of PCP-treated weanling females, whereas plasma concentrations of total thyroxine were decreased in dams and weanling pups, and plasma thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations were higher in PCP-treated weanling males. PCP caused a decrease in plasma corticosterone concentrations in 12-week-old female rats, but not in male rats or weanling females. PCP-treated male pups had significantly increased testis weight at 12 week of age. No overt signs of toxicity were noted throughout this study. Our results show that PCP exposure during development causes thyroid function vulnerability, testicular hypertrophy in adults, and aberrations of brain gene expression.","Nrgn protein, rat,Pesticides,Synapsins,Thyroid Hormone Receptors beta,Neurogranin,Thyrotropin,Pentachlorophenol,Thyroxine,Corticosterone","Leydig cell,Sertoli cell,apoptosis,bisphenol,germ cell,tight junction","Animals,Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Humans,Infertility, Male,Leydig Cells,Male,Phenols,Reproductive Health,Sertoli Cells,Spermatogenesis,Testis"

However, it is unclear whether and how BDE3 affects the development of fetal testes. This study aimed to investigate the effect of in utero exposure to BDE3 on fetal testicular development in rats. From gestational day (GD) 12-21, BDE3 (0, 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg) was daily gavaged to female pregnant Sprague Dawley rats. BDE3 significantly reduced serum testosterone levels of male pups starting at 50 mg/kg. BDE3 reduced fetal Leydig cell number at a dose of 200 mg/kg without affecting fetal Leydig cell cluster frequency and Sertoli cell number. In addition, BDE3 down-regulated the expression of fetal Leydig cell genes (Cyp11a1, Hsd3b1, Cyp17a1, and Hsd17b3) and their proteins at 100 and/or 200 mg/kg. RNA-seq analysis showed that genes responsive to cAMP (Ass1, Gpd1, Rpl13a) were down-regulated and hypoxia-related genes (Egln3 and P4ha1) were up-regulated at 200 mg/kg. In utero exposure to BDE3 can promote autophagy and apoptosis of fetal Leydig cells via increasing the levels of Beclin1, LC3-II, BAX, and by decreasing the levels of p62 and BCL2. In conclusion, in utero exposure to BDE3 blocks the development of fetal rat testes.","4-bromodiphenyl ether,Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers","Bisphenol A,environmental endocrine disruptor,epigenetic changes,male fertility,sperm function,sperm function related signalingpathways","Animals,Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Humans,Male,Phenols,Spermatozoa"

36173044,-117,Bisphenol A,Metabolic,Bisphenol A-Induced Endocrine Dysfunction and its Associated Metabolic Disorders.,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine-disrupting chemical widely present in many consumer goods that poses a significant threat to our health upon exposure. Humans are exposed to BPA, which directly or indirectly causes endocrine dysfunctions that lead to metabolic disorders like obesity, fatty liver diseases, insulin resistance, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and other endocrine-related imbalances. The duration, quantity, and period of exposure to BPA, especially during the critical stage of development, determine its impact on reproductive and non-reproductive health. Because of its endocrine-disrupting effects, the European Chemical Agency has added BPA to the candidate list of chemicals of very high concern. Due to its estrogenic properties and structural similarities with thyroid hormones, BPA disrupts the endocrine system at different levels. It interacts with estrogen receptors at the molecular level and acts as an antagonist or agonist via an estrogen receptor-dependent signaling pathway. In particular, BPA binds to G-protein coupled receptors and estrogen receptors, activating signaling pathways that influence cellular apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation, and inflammation. BPA acts as an obesogen that promotes adipogenesis and correlates with increased lipid accumulation and elevated expression of adipogenic markers. As a metabolic and endocrine disruptor, BPA impairs cellular homeostasis by increasing oxidative mediators and decreasing antioxidant enzymes, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction. Due to its endocrine-disrupting properties, BPA exposure induces endocrine dysfunctions, causing metabolic syndrome. This review gives a recent development and novel insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of BPA-induced endocrine dysfunctions and their associated metabolic disorders.",,,"Animals,Benzhydryl Compounds,Histone Deacetylase 2,Liver,Male,Mice,Oxidative Stress,Phenols,Valproic Acid"

Accordingly, glyphosate exposure from food and water, the environment, and accidental and occupational venues has also increased. Recent studies have demonstrated a relationship between glyphosate exposure and a number of disorders such as cancer, immune and metabolic disorders, endocrine disruption, imbalance of intestinal flora, cardiovascular disease, and infertility; these results have given glyphosate a considerable amount of media and scientific attention. Notably, glyphosate is a powerful metal chelator, which could help explain some of its effects. Recently, our findings on 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid, another metal chelator, showed deterioration of oocyte quality. Here, to generalize, we investigated the effects of glyphosate (0 - 300 ŒºM) on metaphase II mouse oocyte quality and embryo damage to obtain insight on its mechanisms of cellular action and the tolerance of oocytes and embryos towards this chemical. Our work shows for the first time that glyphosate exposure impairs metaphase II mouse oocyte quality via two mechanisms: 1) disruption of the microtubule organizing center and chromosomes such as anomalous pericentrin formation, spindle fiber destruction and disappearance, and defective chromosomal alignment and 2) substantial depletion of intracellular zinc bioavailability and enhancement of reactive oxygen species accumulation. Similar effects were found in embryos. These results may help clarify the effects of glyphosate exposure on female fertility and provide counseling and preventative steps for excessive glyphosate intake and resulting oxidative stress and reduced zinc bioavailability.","Herbicides,Reactive Oxygen Species,glyphosate,Zinc,Glycine","Endocrine disrupting chemicals,Food composites,Liquid chromatography‚Äìmass spectrometry,Ultrasound-assisted liquid extraction","Animals,Benzhydryl Compounds,Phenols,Phthalic Acids,Plasticizers,Plastics,South Africa"

A total of 64 rats were divided into 4 treatment groups as mg DBP/Kg body weight per day: (a) 0\u2009mg/Kg (control), (b) 10\u2009mg/Kg (DBP-10), (c) 50\u2009mg/Kg (DBP-50), and (d) 100\u2009mg/Kg (DBP-100).

Macrophages are one of the most important immune cells in innate and adaptive immunity. In this study, we aimed to probe the effects of BPA on the damage of RAW264.7 cells and its mechanisms of action, especially focusing on the relationship between autophagy and apoptosis. Cells were pretreated with 10¬†mg/L LPS, or added autophagy activator RAPA, autophagy inhibitor 3-MA or Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-737, then treated with BPA (0, 10, 100 and 200 Œºmol/L) for 12¬†h. Results have shown that BPA decreased the cell viability and disrupted secretory function by promoting pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-Œ± and IL-6 and reducing anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10¬†TGF-Œ≤, as well as phagocytic ability. Moreover, autophagy was inhibited by BPA through decreasing p-AMPK/AMPK and increasing p-mTOR/mTOR, and further down-regulating autophagy proteins ATG6, LC3II/I ratio, and up-regulating autophagy flux protein p62. Additionally, BPA significantly increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, Caspase-3 expression and apoptosis rate. We found that RAPA ameliorated the cell viability, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, and macrophage function damage induced by BPA. Intriguingly, ABT-737 might promote ATG6 expression. In summary, our study demonstrated that the effects of BPA on macrophages seemed to be mediated by inhibiting AMPK/mTOR-dependent autophagy and inducing apoptosis via endogenous mitochondrial pathway. Both Bcl-2 and ATG6 were involved in the regulation of apoptosis and autophagy by BPA. These findings provide a broader perspective for understanding the interaction between autophagy and apoptosis in BPA-induced immune cell injury.",,,"Animals,Biological Assay,Chironomidae,Estradiol Congeners,Ethinyl Estradiol,Larva,Mouth,Survival Analysis,Toxicity Tests,Water Pollutants"
33223334,-116,bisphenol A,Reproductive,Serum bisphenol A analogues in women diagnosed with the polycystic ovary syndrome - is there an association?,"Due to the endocrine disrupting effects of bisphenol A (BPA) several governmental authorities have banned its use and the manufacturers had to find alternative substances with similar chemical properties. This led to the increase in the use of so-called BPA analogues, which however also turn out to possess mild estrogenic and ani-androgenic properties and thus, may cause fertility problems and sex-hormone dependent endocrinopathies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential association between the exposure to BPA and its two analogues: BPS and BPF, with the diagnosis of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which remains the most common female endocrinopathy. Serum concentrations of BPA, BPS and BPF were measured using high performance liquid chromatography method with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) among 199 women with PCOS and 158 control subjects. In women with PCOS serum BPS concentrations were significantly higher compared to the control subjects (geometric mean [95% CI]: 0.14¬†ng/mL [0.10; 1.17] vs. 0.08¬†ng/mL [0.06; 0.09], P¬†=¬†0.023). Serum BPA and BPF concentrations did not differ between the studied groups. There was however a negative correlation between serum BPA and HOMA-IR (r¬†=¬†- 0.233, P¬†=¬†0.001) and TST (r¬†=¬†- 0.203, P¬†=¬†0.006) in women with PCOS. No correlations were found between the serum BPs and other metabolic parameters such as serum lipids, insulin, DHEA-S, androstenedione and FAI. When studying the association between serum BPA analogues and PCOS it turned out that women whose serum BPS concentrations were in the first tertile were more likely to be diagnosed with this endocrinopathy (OR [95% CI]: 1.21 [1.04; 3.46], P¬†=¬†0.017). This association was also statistically significant when adjusted for age, education, BMI, smoking, income, and alcohol consumption (adjusted OR [95% CI]: 1.12 [1.03; 3.71], P¬†=¬†0.029).

This study aimed to examine the associations between maternal prenatal Bisphenol A (BPA) exposure and child cardio-metabolic risk factors at age 2 years in a prospective cohort. During 2012-2013, 218 pregnant women were enrolled at late pregnancy from Shanghai, China. Urinary BPA concentration was measured in prenatal and child 2-year spot urine samples, and classified into high, medium and low tertiles. Child adiposity anthropometric measurements, random morning plasma glucose, serum insulin, and lipids (high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, cholesterol, triglyceride), systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured. Linear regression was used to evaluate the associations between prenatal BPA and each of the cardio-metabolic risk factors in boys and girls, respectively, adjusting for pertinent prenatal, perinatal and postnatal factors. BPA was detectable (>0.1¬†Œºg/L) in 98.2% of mothers prenatally and 99.4% of children at age 2 years. Compared to those with low prenatal BPA, mean SBP was 7.0 (95%CI: 2.9-11.2) mmHg higher, and DBP was 4.4 (95%CI: 1.2-7.5) mmHg higher in girls with high prenatal BPA levels, but these associations were not found in boys. In boys, medium maternal prenatal BPA level was associated with 0.36 (95% CI: 0.04-0.68) mmol/L higher plasma glucose. No associations were found between prenatal BPA and child BMI, skinfold thicknesses, serum lipids, or insulin in either girls or boys. There were no associations between concurrent child urinary BPA and cardio-metabolic risk factors. These results support that BPA exposure during prenatal period, susceptible time for fetal development, may be associated with increase in child BP and plasma glucose in a sex-specific manner. Further independent cohort studies are needed to confirm the findings.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Phenols,bisphenol A",,"Animals,Biological Clocks,Circadian Rhythm,Hypothalamus,Light,Reproduction,Suprachiasmatic Nucleus"

DBP is readily released into air, drinking water, and soil, and unfortunately, is a potent endocrine disrupter that impairs central nervous system functions. Previously DBP was found to (1) arrest the cell cycle of C17.2 neural progenitor cells (NPCs) at the G1 phase, (2) reduce numbers of newly generated neural stem cells in the mouse hippocampus, and (3) adversely affect learning and memory. Other investigators also noted DBP-mediated neurotoxic effects, but as yet, no study has addressed the adverse effects of DBP on neuronal differentiation. Data demonstrated that at 200\xa0ŒºM DBP induced apoptosis in rat embryo primary neurons by increasing reactive oxygen species levels and inducing mitochondrial dysfunction. However, no significant effect was detected on neurons at concentrations of ‚â§100\xa0ŒºM. In contrast, doublecortin/microtubule associated protein-2 (DCX/MAP2) immunocytochemistry showed that DBP at 100\xa0ŒºM delayed neuronal maturation by increasing protein levels of DCX (an immature neuronal marker), without markedly affecting cell viability. Further  studies confirmed that DCX cell numbers were significantly elevated in the hippocampus of DBP-treated mice, indicating that DBP delayed neuronal maturation, which is known to be associated with impaired memory retention. Data demonstrated that DBP might disrupt neuronal maturation, which is correlated with reduced neurocognitive functions.'}","Plasticizers,Dibutyl Phthalate",,"Animals,Biological Clocks,CLOCK Proteins,Circadian Rhythm,Humans,Metabolic Networks and Pathways,Metabolic Syndrome,Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group D, Member 1"

24594937,-116,bisphenol A,Cancer,Exposure to bisphenol A correlates with early-onset prostate cancer and promotes centrosome amplification and anchorage-independent growth in vitro.,"Human exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) is ubiquitous. Animal studies found that BPA contributes to development of prostate cancer, but human data are scarce. Our study examined the association between urinary BPA levels and Prostate cancer and assessed the effects of BPA on induction of centrosome abnormalities as an underlying mechanism promoting prostate carcinogenesis. The study, involving 60 urology patients, found higher levels of urinary BPA (creatinine-adjusted) in Prostate cancer patients (5.74 ¬µg/g [95% CI; 2.63, 12.51]) than in non-Prostate cancer patients (1.43 ¬µg/g [95% CI; 0.70, 2.88]) (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.012). The difference was even more significant in patients <65 years old. A trend toward a negative association between urinary BPA and serum PSA was observed in Prostate cancer patients but not in non-Prostate cancer patients. In vitro studies examined centrosomal abnormalities, microtubule nucleation, and anchorage-independent growth in four Prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, C4-2, 22Rv1, PC-3) and two immortalized normal prostate epithelial cell lines (NPrEC and RWPE-1). Exposure to low doses (0.01-100 nM) of BPA increased the percentage of cells with centrosome amplification two- to eight-fold. Dose responses either peaked or reached the plateaus with 0.1 nM BPA exposure. This low dose also promoted microtubule nucleation and regrowth at centrosomes in RWPE-1 and enhanced anchorage-independent growth in C4-2. These findings suggest that urinary BPA level is an independent prognostic marker in Prostate cancer and that BPA exposure may lower serum PSA levels in Prostate cancer patients. Moreover, disruption of the centrosome duplication cycle by low-dose BPA may contribute to neoplastic transformation of the prostate.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Phenols,bisphenol A",,"Animals,Biomarkers, Tumor,Cells, Cultured,Coculture Techniques,Humans,Mesenchymal Stem Cells,Mice,Multiple Myeloma,Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled,Receptors, Kisspeptin-1,Tumor Microenvironment"

Both administrations of CBZ caused a hypothyroidism in dams and fetuses whereas the decreases in serum thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) and increases in serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels were highly significant (LSD; P <0.01) at GD 20 compared to untreated control dams. Also, both administrations had undesirable impacts on the maternofetal body weight, litter weight, survival of dams and fetuses, and their food consumption in comparison to the corresponding control. These administrations also elicited a reduction in fetal serum growth hormone (GH), interferon-Œ≥ (IFNŒ≥), interleukins (IL-2 & 4) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels. Also, the elevation in fetal serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFŒ±), transforming growth factor-beta (TGFŒ≤), and interleukins (IL-1Œ≤ & 17) levels was observed at embryonic day (ED) 20. Moreover, there were a cellular fragmentation, distortion, hyperemia, oedema and vacuolation in the fetal cerebellar cortex due to both maternal administrations. These developmental changes were dose-dependent. These novel results suggest that CBZ may act as a developmental immunoneuroendocrine disruptor.","Anticonvulsants,Cytokines,Triiodothyronine,Carbamazepine,Thyrotropin,Growth Hormone,Thyroxine","Biomarker,Di-isodecyl phthalate,Metabolites,Toxicokinetics,UHPLC‚ÄìESI-MS/MS","Animals,Biomarkers,Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid,Male,Phthalic Acids,Plasticizers,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization,Tandem Mass Spectrometry,Toxicokinetics"

Adult male and female nonobese diabetic excluded flora (NODEF) mice were exposed to environmentally relevant doses of BPS (VH, 30, or 300 Œºg/kg BW) and fed either a soy-based diet, a phytoestrogen-free diet, or a Western diet. NODEF male mice fed a soy-based diet exhibited a decreased curiosity/desire to explore, and possibly increased anxiety-like behavior and decreased short-term memory when exposed to BPS (300 Œºg/kg BW). In addition, these mice had significant increases in non-fasting blood glucose levels along with increased insulin sensitivity, impaired glucose tolerance, resistance to fasting and proinflammation. Although BPS had little effect on the glucose parameters in NODEF male mice fed a Western diet, there were decreases in %CD24CD5 and %B220CD40Lcell populations and increases in distance traveled during the novel object test, suggesting hyperactivity. NODEF females fed a phytoestrogen-free diet exhibited slight decreases in time spent immobile during the tail suspension test in both the 30 and 300 Œºg/kg BW dose groups along with increases in %CD4CD8 and %Mac3CD45R cell populations, signifying increased hyperactivity and anxiety-like behavior.

Bisphenol A is emblematic of such disruptors, as it impairs meiotic prophase I and causes oocyte aneuploidy following in utero exposure. However, the mechanisms underlying these deleterious effects remain poorly understood. Furthermore, the increasing use of BPA alternatives raises concerns for public health. Here, we investigated the effects of foetal exposure to two BPA alternatives, bisphenol A Diglycidyl Ether (BADGE) and bisphenol AF (BPAF), on oogenesis in mice. These compounds delay meiosis initiation, increase the number of MLH1 foci per cell and induce oocyte aneuploidy. We further demonstrate that these defects are accompanied by changes in gene expression in foetal premeiotic germ cells and aberrant mRNA splicing of meiotic genes. We observed an increase in DNA oxidation after exposure to BPA alternatives. Specific induction of oxidative DNA damage during foetal germ cell differentiation causes similar defects during oogenesis, as observed in 8-oxoguanine DNA Glycosylase (OGG1)-deficient mice or after in utero exposure to potassium bromate (KBrO3), an inducer of oxidative DNA damage. The supplementation of BPA alternatives with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) counteracts the effects of bisphenols on meiosis. Together, our results propose oxidative DNA lesion as an event that negatively impacts female meiosis with major consequences on oocyte quality.

It is well-established that B[a]P may produce toxicities including cancer, endocrine disruption, and phototoxicity involving DNA damage, free radical generation, and down regulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). It is well-known that Nrf2 is associated increase of antioxidant enzyme catalase (CAT) or detoxification enzyme glutathione S-transferase (GST) in HaCat cells treated with B[a]P under optimal condition of hyperoxia (40% oxygenation) conditions. To further examine the underlying basis of this phenomenon, factors affecting the expression of Nrf2 were determined. Nrf2 was upregulated accompanied by a rise in p38 MAPK, sequestosome-1 (also known as p62) and NF-Œ∫B. In contrast, Nrf2 was downregulated associated with an elevation in glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3Œ≤) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARŒ±). Hyperoxia was also found to diminish DNA damage and generation of free radicals initiated in B[a]-treated cells which was attributed to an significant rise of Nrf2, leading to elevated antioxidant activities or detoxification proteins including heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase-1/2 (GPX-1/2), CAT, GST and glutathione (GSH). In addition, factors related to skin aging were also altered by hyperoxia.

Exposure to PFOA is associated with reproductive and developmental effects including endocrine disruption, delayed puberty in girls, and decreased fetal growth. In the United States, obesity affects 40% of women and 20% of girls, with higher rates in minority females. Obesity causes infertility, poor oocyte quality, miscarriage, and offspring defects. This study proposed that PFOA exposure would impact estrous cyclicity, ovarian steroid hormones, and the ovarian proteome and further hypothesized that obesity would impact PFOA-induced ovotoxicity. Female wild type (KK.Cg-a/a; lean) or KK.Cg-Ay/J mice (obese) received saline (CT) or PFOA (2.5‚Äâmg/kg) per os for 15‚Äâdays beginning at 7‚Äâweeks of age. There were no effects on food intake, body weight, estrous cyclicity, serum progesterone, and heart, spleen, kidney, or uterus weight (p‚Äâ>‚Äâ.05). Ovary weight was decreased (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ.05) by PFOA exposure relative to vehicle control-treated mice in lean but not obese mice. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was performed on isolated ovarian protein and PFOA exposure altered the ovarian abundance of proteins involved in DNA damage sensing and repair pathways and reproduction pathways (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ.05) differentially in lean and obese mice. The data suggest that PFOA exposure alters ovary weight and differentially targets ovarian proteins in lean and obese females in ways that might reduce female fecundity.","perfluorooctanoic acid,Fluorocarbons","DiBP,GC-MS,Inhalation,Phthalates,Toxicokinetics","Animals,Blood Chemical Analysis,Dibutyl Phthalate,Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry,Inhalation Exposure,Male,Phthalic Acids,Rats,Rats, Wistar,Toxicokinetics"
33513405,-115,benzo(a)pyrene,Reproductive,Parental exposure to benzo(a)pyrene in the peripubertal period impacts reproductive aspects of the F1 generation in rats.,"Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) is an ubiquitous environmental pollutant which can lead to adverse effects on male reproduction. However, the persistence of these changes on a multigenerational scale has not been sufficiently explored. This study evaluated if peripubertal exposure to BaP in male rats can induce reproductive impairment in offspring. Male rats received BaP at environmentally relevant doses (0, 0.1, 1, or 10‚ÄØŒºg/kg/day) orally from post-natal (PND) 23-53. On PND 90, treated males were mated with non-treated females for obtaining the next generation (F1). The paternal exposure to BaP decreased the body weight of offspring on PND 1, 13 and 22, as well as it provoked a reduction in the relative anogenital distance of the males. This exposure also brought forward the onset of puberty, evidenced by an earlier vaginal opening and first estrous in females of the lowest dose group and by a delay in the testicular descent and preputial separation ages in males. The males presented a decrease in the daily sperm production and a disrupted sperm morphology. Furthermore, the testicular histology was altered, evidenced by a reduction in the Leydig cell numbers and in the seminiferous tubules diameter, as well as a disrupted seminiferous tubules staging. The estrous cyclicity and some fertility parameters were changed in the females, as well as alterations in the ovary and uterus histology were observed. BaP compromised several reproductive parameters of the F1 generation, suggesting that peripubertal exposure to this compound provokes permanent modifications in male germ line of F0 generation.","Environmental Pollutants,Benzo(a)pyrene","6-sulfatoxymelatonin,Anticipatory thirst,Cosinor analysis,Energy efficiency,Energy intake,Pancreatic Œ≤-cells","Animals,Blood Glucose,Body Temperature,Circadian Rhythm,DNA Methylation,Drinking,Energy Metabolism,Epigenesis, Genetic,Hormones,Insulin,Light,Male,Melatonin,Rats,Time Factors"
32235866,-115,di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate,Reproductive,"Germline-dependent transmission of male reproductive traits induced by an endocrine disruptor, di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate, in future generations.","In males, defective reproductive traits induced by an exposure to an endocrine disruptor are transmitted to future generations via epigenetic modification of the germ cells. Interestingly, the impacted future generations display a wide range of heterogeneity in their reproductive traits. In this study, the role that the Y chromosome plays in creating such heterogeneity is explored by testing the hypothesis that the Y chromosome serves as a carrier of the exposure impact to future generations. This hypothesis implies that a male who has a Y chromosome that is from a male that was exposed to an endocrine disruptor will display a more severe reproductive phenotype than a male whose Y chromosome is from an unexposed male. To test this hypothesis, we used a mouse model in which F1 generation animals were exposed prenatally to an endocrine disruptor, di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), and the severity of impacted reproductive traits was compared between the F3 generation males that were descendants of F1 males (paternal lineage) and those from F1 females (maternal lineage). Pregnant dams (F0 generation) were exposed to the vehicle or 20 or 200‚ÄâŒºg/kg/day of DEHP from gestation day 11 until birth. Paternal lineage F3 DEHP males exhibited decreased fertility, testicular steroidogenic capacity, and spermatogenesis that were more severely impaired than those of maternal lineage males. Indeed, testicular transcriptome analysis found that a number of Y chromosomal genes had altered expression patterns in the paternal lineage males. This transgenerational difference in the DEHP impact can be attributed specifically to the Y chromosome.","Endocrine Disruptors,Diethylhexyl Phthalate","Bisphenol S,Inflammation,Intestine,Metabolism,Perinatal exposure","Animals,Blood Glucose,Body Weight,Cytokines,Endocrine Disruptors,Feces,Female,Inflammation,Intestines,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Phenols,Pregnancy,Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects,Sulfones"
33249230,-115,Cadmium,Reproductive,Delay in puberty indices of Wistar rats caused by Cadmium. Focus on the redox system in reproductive organs.,"Puberty is a transitional period from juvenile stage to adulthood, followed by the functional maturation of gonads and reproductive organs. This period is sensitive to environmental pollutants like cadmium (Cd), a heavy metal that represents a serious health risk. Cd is an endocrine disruptor that interferes with reproduction by causing oxidative stress in the reproductive organs, affecting the sexual function and decreasing testosterone (T) levels. However, little research has been done on the effects of Cd on puberty markers and antioxidant systems. In this study, we evaluated the effects of Cd on puberty markers: preputial separation, testes descent and T levels, and the antioxidant activity (SOD, CAT, GSH/GSSG and TAC) in the seminal vesicles, testis and epididymis. Male Wistar pups were treated with 1‚ÄØmg/kg Cd or saline solution by i.p. injection from day 1 to 35; the other treatment was administrated for 49 days. At the end of treatment, the animals were sacrificed, and the tissues of interest dissected, weighed and prepared for the respective assays. Cd treated rats from birth to puberty showed a delay onset in the puberty markers and a low weight in reproductive organs. Also, Cd induced differential effects on the redox system in reproductive organs and decreased T levels, these effects played a pivotal role in the delay of puberty markers onset (testes descent and preputial separation), affecting the development and sexual maturity of the male rats.","Environmental Pollutants,Cadmium,Testosterone,Catalase,Superoxide Dismutase,Glutathione",,"Animals,Blood Glucose,Circadian Rhythm,Glucose,Glucose Tolerance Test,Homeostasis,Humans,Hypothalamus,Liver"
32633424,-115,di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate,Neurological,Postnatal di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate exposure affects hippocampal dentate gyrus morphogenesis.,"Di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) is the most commonly used phthalate for the production of flexible polyvinyl chloride. Recent studies in humans reported a widespread DEHP exposure, raising concerns in infants whose metabolic and excretory systems are immature. DEHP is a potential endocrine-disrupting chemical, but the effects of postnatal DEHP exposure on neuronal development are unclear. The dentate gyrus (DG) is critical in the consolidation of information from short- to long-term memory, as well as spatial learning. We evaluated neurodevelopmental toxicity due to neonatal DEHP exposure by assessing neurogenesis in the DG. Newborn mice were orally administered DEHP from postnatal day (PND) 12 to 25. We performed immunostaining using neuronal markers at different stages to assess whether DEHP exposure affects neurons at specific differentiation stages at PND 26 and PND 110. We found that in mice, postnatal DEHP exposure led to a decrease in the number of Type-1, -2a, -2b, and -3 neural progenitor cells, as well as granule cells in the hippocampal DG at PND 26. Further, the results showed that neural progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation were also reduced in the hippocampal DG of the DEHP-exposed mice. However, no effect on memory and learning was observed. Overall, our results suggest that neurodevelopmental toxicity due to postnatal DEHP exposure might affect postnatal DG morphogenesis.","Plasticizers,Diethylhexyl Phthalate","Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate,FoxO1,Gluconeogenesis,Gut microbiota,Insulin resistance,Lipid metabolism","Animals,Blood Glucose,Diethylhexyl Phthalate,Forkhead Box Protein O1,Glucose,Insulin Resistance,Lipids,Male,Mice,Phthalic Acids"

34088158,-112,Dibutyl phthalate,Cell damage,Dibutyl phthalate disrupts conserved circadian rhythm in Drosophila and human cells.,"People are constantly exposed to phthalates, due to their common use in the production of plastics, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and skin care products. The ability of phthalates to disrupt endocrine signaling, leading to developmental, reproductive and metabolic defects, has been studied, yet how phthalates interfere with these biological functions is still unclear. To uncover DBP interacting molecular pathways, we raised Drosophila melanogaster on food containing dibutyl phthalate (DBP) at various concentrations. Whole transcriptome analysis of adult Drosophila reveals that DBP exposure throughout development disrupts the expression of genes central to circadian rhythm regulation, including increased expression of vrille (vri, human NFIL3), timeless (tim, human TIMELESS) and period (per, human PER3), with decreased expression of Pigment-dispersing factor (Pdf). DBP exposure also alters the expression of the evolutionarily conserved nuclear receptor Hormone receptor-like in 38 (Hr38, human NR4A2), which is known to regulate Pdf expression. Furthermore, behavioral assays determined that exposing Drosophila to DBP throughout development modifies the circadian rhythm of adults. Although DBP inhibits the expression of signaling systems regulating vision, including Rh5 and Rh6, two light-sensing G-protein coupled receptors involved in the daily resetting of circadian rhythm, it does not influence eye development. Circadian rhythm genes are well conserved from flies to humans; therefore, we tested the effect of DBP exposure on human breast cells (MCF10A) and demonstrate that, similar to the fruit fly model, this exposure disrupts circadian rhythm (BMAL1 expression) at doses that promote the proliferation and migration ability of MCF10A cells. Our results are the first to provide comprehensive evidence that DBP interferes with circadian rhythm in both adult Drosophila and human cells, which may help to explain the broad physiological action of phthalates.","Drosophila Proteins,Hr38 protein, Drosophila,Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear,Dibutyl Phthalate",,"Animals,Cell Adhesion Molecules,Cell Culture Techniques,Cells, Cultured,Endometrium,Female,Gene Expression Regulation,Humans,Menstrual Cycle,Progesterone,RNA, Messenger,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Stromal Cells,Time Factors,Tissue Distribution,Uterus"

Research suggests that exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals such as phthalates may play a role, but studies of in utero phthalate exposure and ADHD-related symptoms beyond early childhood are limited. We investigated associations between measures of in utero phthalate exposure and ADHD symptoms, such as inattention and impulsivity, in childhood (age 6-11 years, n¬†=¬†221) and in adolescence (age 9-18 years, n¬†=¬†200), as well as cross-sectional relationships between phthalate exposure and ADHD symptoms in adolescence (n¬†=¬†491) among participants in the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental Toxicants (ELEMENT) cohort. Women provided urine samples up to three times during pregnancy and adolescents provided a urine sample at 9-18 years of age for phthalate metabolite measurement. We administered the Conners' Continuous Performance Test (CPT) when children were age 6-11 years and again at 9-18 years of age. We used multivariable linear regression to examine associations between the geometric mean of phthalate metabolite levels across pregnancy and CPT scores in childhood or adolescence separately, adjusting for age, years schooling (at 9-18 only), maternal education, and specific gravity. Although average in utero phthalate concentrations were not associated with CPT scores in childhood, interquartile range (IQR) increases of in utero MBzP, MCPP, and MBP were associated with 4.2%, 4.7%, and 4.5% (p¬†<¬†0.05) higher Omissions scores in adolescence, respectively, indicating higher inattention. In utero MiBP levels were also associated with higher Inter-Stimulus Interval (ISI) and Variability scores (5.4% and 5.5% per IQR, p¬†<¬†0.05) in adolescence. In addition, urinary DEHP metabolite levels during adolescence were cross-sectionally associated with poorer scores on several CPT indices indicating greater inattention.

Pregnant Wistar rats were orally administered ATO (5 or 10 mg/kg) from gestation day (GD) 1 to 20. Both doses of ATO diminished free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine levels and augmented thyrotropin level in both dams and fetuses at GD 20. Also, the maternofetal hypothyroidism in both groups caused a dose-dependent reduction in the fetal serum growth hormone, insulin growth factor-I (IGF-I), and IGF-II levels at embryonic day (ED) 20. These disorders perturbed the maternofetal body weight, fetal brain weight, and survival of pregnant and their fetuses. In addition, destructive degeneration, vacuolation, hyperplasia, and edema were observed in the fetal thyroid and cerebrum of both ATO groups at ED 20. These disruptions appear to depend on intensification in the values of lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide, and HO, suppression of messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, and activation of mRNA expression of caspase-3, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, cyclooxygenase-2, Bcl-2-associated X protein, and inducible nitric oxide synthase in the fetal cerebrum.

Among these pollutants, the widely used pesticide glyphosate has been associated with endocrine disruption, autism, and cancer. Occupational high exposure to glyphosate has also been shown to influence immune function and exacerbate allergic asthma. However, there are no studies investigating the effect of a common low-dose glyphosate exposure on the allergic immune response - neither directly nor across generations. We therefore explored the impact of oral low-dose glyphosate exposure (0.5 and 50 mg/kg body weight/day) on airway inflammation in dams (F0) and the offspring (F1 and F2 generations) using a murine multi-generational asthma model. While exposure to 50 mg/kg glyphosate induced a mild eosinophilic infiltration in the bronchoalveolar lavage and T2 cytokine production in the dams, the F1 offspring developed a reduced immune response after maternal exposure to 0.5 mg/kg glyphosate. In particular, decreased lung inflammation, HDM-specific IgE levels, and asthma-relevant cytokine production were primarily observed in the female F1 offspring. However, not only the T2 cytokines IL-13 and IL-5 but also the T17 cytokine IL-17 and T1 cytokine IFN-Œ≥ were reduced indicating a more general immunosuppressive function. Notably, the dampened immune response was no longer observed in the female F2 generation. Furthermore, female F1 offspring showed an increased abundance of bacteria in the gut, which have been associated with probiotic-mediated reduced allergic immune responses. Our results suggest a potential immunosuppressive effect of low-dose maternal glyphosate exposure in the F1 offspring that might be mediated by an altered microbiota composition. Further studies are needed to explore if this type of immune response modulation might also be associated with impairments in immune defense upon infectious diseases or even cancer pathology.'}","Cytokines,Environmental Pollutants,Interleukin-13,Interleukin-17,Interleukin-5,Pesticides,Immunoglobulin E,glyphosate,Glycine","LNCaP,NED,hyperactive mTOR,interferon regulatory factor 1","Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cell Growth Processes,Cell Line, Tumor,Gene Knockout Techniques,Heterografts,Humans,Interferon Regulatory Factor-1,Male,Mice,Neuroendocrine Tumors,Prostatic Neoplasms,Receptors, Androgen,TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases,Up-Regulation"

Exposure to BPA is especially dangerous if it occurs during specific ""critical periods"" of life, when organisms are more sensitive to hormonal changes (i.e., intrauterine, perinatal, juvenile or puberty periods). In this study, we focused on the effects of chronic exposure to BPA in adult female mice starting during pregnancy. Three months old C57BL/6J females were orally exposed to BPA or to vehicle (corn oil). The treatment (4 ¬µg/kg body weight/day) started the day 0 of pregnancy and continued throughout pregnancy, lactation, and lasted for a total of 20 weeks. BPA-treated dams did not show differences in body weight or food intake, but they showed an altered estrous cycle compared to the controls. In order to evidence alterations in social and sociosexual behaviors, we performed the Three-Chamber test for sociability, and analyzed two hypothalamic circuits (well-known targets of endocrine disruption) particularly involved in the control of social behavior: the vasopressin and the oxytocin systems. The test revealed some alterations in the displaying of social behavior: BPA-treated dams have higher locomotor activity compared to the control dams, probably a signal of high level of anxiety. In addition, BPA-treated dams spent more time interacting with no-tester females than with no-tester males. In brain sections, we observed a decrease of vasopressin immunoreactivity (only in the paraventricular and suprachiasmatic nuclei) of BPA-treated females, while we did not find any alteration of the oxytocin system. In parallel, we have also observed, in the same hypothalamic nuclei, a significant reduction of the membrane estrogen receptor GPER1 expression.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,GPER1 protein, mouse,Phenols,Receptors, Estrogen,Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled,Vasopressins,bisphenol A","cells,enteric nervous system,enteric neural crest,human intestinal organoids,human pluripotent stem cells,tissue-engineered small intestine","Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cell Line,Enteric Nervous System,Enteroendocrine Cells,Epithelial Cells,Gene Expression Profiling,Gene Ontology,Humans,Intestinal Mucosa,Intestine, Small,Mice, Inbred NOD,Mice, SCID,Neural Crest,Neuroglia,Organoids,Pluripotent Stem Cells,Sensory Receptor Cells,Synapses,Tissue Engineering,Transcriptome"

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly complex neurodevelopmental disorder that is considered strongly genetic in origin due to its high heritability. However, the rapidly rising prevalence of ASD suggests that environmental factors may also influence risk for ASD. In the present study, whole genome bisulfite sequencing was used to identify genome-wide differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in a total of 52 sperm samples from a cohort of men from the Faroe Islands (Denmark) who were equally divided into high and low exposure groups based on their serum levels of the long-lived organochlorine 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (DDE), a primary breakdown product of the now banned insecticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). Aside from being considered a genetic isolate, inhabitants of the Faroe Islands have a native diet that potentially exposes them to a wide range of seafood neurotoxicants in the form of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The DMRs were mapped to the human genome using Bismark, a 3-letter aligner used for methyl-seq analyses. Gene ontology, functional, and pathway analyses of the DMR-associated genes showed significant enrichment for genes involved in neurological functions and neurodevelopmental processes frequently impacted by ASD. Notably, these genes also significantly overlap with autism risk genes as well as those previously identified in sperm from fathers of children with ASD in comparison to that of fathers of neurotypical children. These results collectively suggest a possible mechanism involving altered methylation of a significant number of neurologically relevant ASD risk genes for introducing epigenetic changes associated with environmental exposures into the sperm methylome.

Caesarean sections were performed on GD 18, and implantations, resorptions and live and dead fetuses were counted. Half of each litter was fixed and examined for visceral anomalies while the remaining fetuses were cleared and stained with Alizarin Red S for skeleton evaluation. A reduced pregnancy weight gain (after subtraction of uterine weights), smaller thymus, spleen and liver, and deaths indicated that doses > or = 7.5mg/kg body wt/day were toxic to mothers. At the two highest doses, TPTH enhanced embryolethality and reduced fetal body weight. The incidence of cleft palate (not seen in controls) was augmented (36.8%) at the highest dose of TPTH, while palatine bone defects were increased at the lowest dose (3.75 mg/kg bw/day). Soft-tissue anomalies, such as misshapened thymus, and malpositioned testes and uteri, were more frequent at doses of TPTH > or = 7.5 mg/kg bw/day. TPTH also caused a dose-related increase of fetal skeleton variations (e.g. poorly ossified skull bones) and malformations (misshapened Axis and skull bones). In conclusion, TPTH was toxic to the embryos (NOAEL <3.75 mg/kg bw/day) at doses that were not overtly toxic to their mothers.","Endocrine Disruptors,Organotin Compounds,triphenyltin hydroxide","ToxPi analyses,administered equivalent doses,alternatives assessment,benchmark concentrations,endocrine disrupting chemical","Animals,Cell Line,Environmental Monitoring,Esters,Female,Flame Retardants,Male,Mice,Organophosphates,Plasticizers"

Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence exists that atrazine disrupts reproductive health and hormone secretion. We examined the relationship between exposure to atrazine in drinking water and menstrual cycle function including reproductive hormone levels. Women 18-40 years old residing in agricultural communities where atrazine is used extensively (Illinois) and sparingly (Vermont) answered a questionnaire (n=102), maintained menstrual cycle diaries (n=67), and provided daily urine samples for analyses of luteinizing hormone (LH), and estradiol and progesterone metabolites (n=35). Markers of exposures included state of residence, atrazine and chlorotriazine concentrations in tap water, municipal water and urine, and estimated dose from water consumption. Women who lived in Illinois were more likely to report menstrual cycle length irregularity (odds ratio (OR)=4.69; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.58-13.95) and more than 6 weeks between periods (OR=6.16; 95% CI: 1.29-29.38) than those who lived in Vermont. Consumption of >2 cups of unfiltered Illinois water daily was associated with increased risk of irregular periods (OR=5.73; 95% CI: 1.58-20.77). Estimated ""dose"" of atrazine and chlorotriazine from tap water was inversely related to mean mid-luteal estradiol metabolite. Atrazine ""dose"" from municipal concentrations was directly related to follicular phase length and inversely related to mean mid-luteal progesterone metabolite levels.

35743120,-111,Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane,Immune,Developmental Exposure to Endocrine Disrupter DDT Interferes with Age-Related Involution of Thymus.,"The impact of endocrine-disrupting chemicals on the development and involution of the immune system is a possible reason for the increased incidence of disorders associated with inappropriate immune function. The thymus is a lymphoid and also an endocrine organ, and, accordingly, its development and functioning may be impaired by endocrine disruptors. The aim was to evaluate age-related thymus involution in mature rats exposed to the endocrine disruptor DDT during prenatal and postnatal ontogeny. Methodology included in vivo experiment on male Wistar rats exposed to low doses of DDT during prenatal and postnatal development and morphological assessment of thymic involution, including the immunohistochemical detection of proliferating thymocytes. The study was carried out at the early stage of involution. Results: DDT-exposed rats exhibited a normal anatomy, and the relative weight of the thymus was within the control ranges. Histological and immunohistochemical examinations revealed increased cellularity of the cortex and the medulla, higher content of lymphoblasts, and more intensive proliferation rate of thymocytes compared to the control. Evaluation of thymic epithelial cells revealed a higher rate of thymic corpuscles formation. Conclusion: The data obtained indicate that endocrine disrupter DDT disturbs postnatal development of the thymus. Low-dose exposure to DDT during ontogeny does not suppress growth rate but violates the developmental program of the thymus by slowing down the onset of age-related involution and maintaining high cell proliferation rate. It may result in excessive formation of thymus-dependent areas in peripheral lymphoid organs and altered immune response.","Endocrine Disruptors,DDT","Endocrine disruptor,Leydig cells,Puberty,Testosterone,Xylene","Animals,Cells, Cultured,Dose-Response Relationship, Drug,Gene Expression Regulation,Leydig Cells,Male,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Reactive Oxygen Species,Sexual Maturation,Testosterone,Vitamin E,Xylenes"

Our previous studies in mice show disruption of metabolic health upon maternal BPA exposure. The current study was undertaken to determine whether exposure in fathers causes adverse metabolic consequences in offspring. Male C57BL/6¬†J mice were exposed to BPA in the diet beginning at 5 weeks of age resulting in the following dietary exposure groups: Control (0¬†Œºg/kg/day), Lower BPA (10¬†Œºg/kg/day) and Upper BPA (10¬†mg/kg/day). After 12 weeks of dietary exposure, males were mated to control females. Mothers and offspring were maintained on the control diet. Post-pubertal paternal BPA exposure did not affect offspring body weight, body composition or glucose tolerance. However, when fathers were exposed to BPA during gestation and lactation, their female offspring displayed impaired glucose tolerance in the absence of compromised in vivo insulin sensitivity or reduced ex vivo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Male offspring exhibited normal glucose tolerance. Taken together, these studies show there is an early window of susceptibility in which paternal BPA exposure can cause sex-specific impairments in glucose homeostasis.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Insulin,Phenols,Glucose,bisphenol A",,"Animals,Cells, Cultured,Drug Synergism,Hepatocytes,Male,PPAR alpha,Phenobarbital,Pyrimidines,Rats,Rats, Wistar,Thyroxine,Triiodothyronine"

34732098,-111,Perfluorooctane sulfonate,Cancer,Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) triggers migration and invasion of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells via regulation of Zeb1.,"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most prevalent and deadly cancers worldwide, especially in Eastern Asia. As a potential endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) can mimic estrogen, disturb the estrogen signals, and then cause various diseases. Although ESCC can be directly exposed to PFOS during food digestion, the effects and mechanisms of PFOS on the development of ESCC are still not well illustrated. This study showed that PFOS can promote the migration and invasion of ESCC cells. Further, PFOS treatment can increase the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9, while decreasing the expression of E-Cadherin (E-Cad). Zeb1, an important transcription factor for cell motility, was essential for PFOS induced migration and invasion of ESCC cells. PFOS can increase the expression of Zeb1 via upregulation of its transcription and proteins stability. A-kinase interacting protein 1 (AKIP1) and ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) were responsible for PFOS induced transcription and proteins stability of Zeb1 in ESCC cells, respectively. Collectively, our data indicated that environmental exposure and body accumulation of PFOS might be an important risk factor for ESCC progression.","Matrix Metalloproteinase 2,perfluorooctane sulfonic acid,Matrix Metalloproteinase 9,Zinc Finger E-box-Binding Homeobox 1,Cadherins,Transcription Factors,Estrogens,ZEB1 protein, human,AKIP1 protein, human",,"Animals,Central Nervous System Stimulants,Circadian Rhythm,Cornea,Feeding Behavior,Female,Kidney,Luciferases,Male,Methamphetamine,Mice,Mice, Transgenic,Motor Activity,Period Circadian Proteins,Pineal Gland,Pituitary Gland,Salivary Glands,Suprachiasmatic Nucleus"

Here, we studied the endocrine disrupting property of BPEF by multiple toxicological tools and investigated its effects on female development in adolescent mice. Using the yeast two-hybrid bioassay, BPEF showed strong antiestrogenicity which was similar to that of tamoxifen, an effective antiestrogenic drug. In adolescent CD-1 mice, BPEF significantly decreased the uterine weight at relatively low doses and induced marked endometrial atrophy. Immunohistochemical staining and transcriptome analyses of the mice uteri revealed that BPEF could repressed the expressions of estrogen-responsive genes. Molecular simulation indicated that BPEF could be docked into the antagonist pocket of human estrogen receptor Œ±, and the formation of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions between BPEF and the active site of receptor maintained their strong binding.

However, it is unknown if prenatal and lactational exposure to IAA affects reproductive outcomes in female offspring. This study tested the hypothesis that prenatal and lactational exposure to IAA adversely affects reproductive parameters in F1 female offspring. Adult female CD-1 mice were dosed with water (control) or IAA (10, 100, and 500¬†mg/L) in the drinking water for 35¬†days and then mated with unexposed males.

In addition, sera were collected to measure reproductive hormone levels. IAA exposure decreased vaginal opening rate, increased the absolute weight of the ovaries, increased anogenital index, and decreased the percentage of atretic follicles in female pups compared to control. IAA exposure caused a borderline decrease in the levels of progesterone and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and increased levels of testosterone in female pups compared to control.

We investigated the effects of administration of PNP in T24 human bladder cancer cells. The results showed that PNP exposure promoted cellular proliferation, migration and invasion, inhibited adhesion and apoptosis in vitro. Using quantitative real-time PCR, we found that (1) the mRNA expression levels of cell-cycle regulators PCNA, cyclin D1 and COX-2 were increased in PNP-treated cells compared to controls, however, that of pro-apoptotic gene Bax was decreased; (2) the expression level of EMT-associated gene E-cadherin was decreased in PNP-treated cells, whereas those of N-cadherin, vimentin, snail, and slug were increased; (3) the expression levels of cancer-promoting genes HIF-1, IL-1Œ≤, VEGFŒ± and K-Ras were enhanced, but those of tumor suppressors p53, PTEN and BRCA were decreased. There was a positive association between PNP exposure times and the promotion effects. Finally, we found that the expression level of PPARŒ≥ (Œ≥1 isoform) was increased in PNP-treated T24 cells. GW9662, a specific PPARŒ≥ antagonist, attenuated PNP-induced cell migration and invasion. These findings indicate that PNP exposure may promote bladder cancer growth and progression involving PPARŒ≥ signaling.

We found that 150 ŒºM of BPB significantly compromised the first polar body extrusion (PBE) and disrupted the cell cycle progression with meiotic arrest. The spindle assembly and chromosome alignment were disordered after BPB exposure, which was further demonstrated by the aberrant localization of p-MAPK. Also, BPB exposure increased the acetylation levels of Œ±-tubulin. As a result, the spindle assemble checkpoint (SAC) was continuously provoked, contributing to meiotic arrest. We further demonstrated that BPB severely induced DNA damage, but the ROS and ATP production were not altered. Furthermore, the epigenetic modifications were changed after BPB exposure, as indicated by increased K3K9me3 and H3K27me3 levels. Besides, the pattern of estrogen receptor Œ± (ERŒ±) dynamics was disrupted with a mass gathering on the spindle in BPB-exposed oocytes.

Groups of 10 male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were administered PCB-156 in the diet at 0, 0.01, 0.1, 1 or 10‚Äâppm for 90 days. Dose-dependent increases were detected for the liver, lung and kidney weights, as well as for the liver EROD, PROD and UDPGT enzyme activities and liver uroporphyrin concentration. Dose-dependent decreases were observed in final body weight, body weight gain, and thymus weight. Apolar retinoid concentrations were decreased in the liver and lungs and increased in the kidneys. Histopathological examination of the liver, thyroid, and thymus showed mild to moderate dose-related changes. A LOAEL of 0.01‚Äâppm was established, based on reduced apolar liver retinoid concentration. Benchmark dose-modelling corroborated the sensitivity of liver retinoid endpoints. The lower confidence limits (BMDL) for a 5% decrease in apolar liver retinoid concentrations were 0.0009 and 0.0007‚Äâppm, respectively, in males and females, corresponding to a daily dose of 0.06‚ÄâŒºg PCB-156 per kg body weight. Organizing dose-response data for the individual hepatic endpoints along the PCB-156 dosing scale revealed a sequence of events compatible with a causal link between depletion of apolar retinoids and the other liver biochemistry and pathology findings.

Bisphenol A (BPA) is one of the most common EDCs found in the environment. Here, we evaluated BPA toxicity on fetal testes using an in¬†vitro organ culture system. Mouse fetal testes sampled at 15.5 days post coitus were cultured in a medium containing BPA for 5 days. The number of germ cells was reduced by BPA treatment, whereas the number of Sertoli cells was slightly increased by BPA at the highest dose (100¬†ŒºM). Consistently, BPA treatment reduced the protein and gene expression levels of germ cell markers, but it increased the expression levels of Sertoli cell markers. The expression levels of fetal Leydig cell markers such as Cyp11a1, Thbs2, Cyp17a1, and Pdgf-Œ± were significantly increased, whereas those of adult Leydig cell markers such as Hsd17b3, Ptgds, Sult1e1, Vcam1, and Hsd11b1 were decreased in the testes exposed to BPA. Generally, Notch signaling restricts Leydig cell differentiation from progenitor cells during fetal testis development. The expression levels of Notch1, Notch2, Notch3, Hes1, Ptch1, Jag1, Jag2, c-Myc, Hey1, and Hey2, which are involved in Notch signaling, were markedly higher in BPA-treated fetal testes than in the controls, indicating that BPA interrupts fetal Leydig cell development. BPA also disrupted steroidogenesis in the fetal testis organ culture system. In conclusion, our study showed that BPA inhibits fetal germ cell growth, Leydig cell development, and steroidogenesis.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Phenols,Testosterone,bisphenol A","Estrogen receptor,Estrogen response element,Estrogenic disrupting compounds,High-performance liquid chromatography,Solid-phase extraction","Animals,Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid,Endocrine Disruptors,Estrogens,Milk,Response Elements,Solid Phase Extraction,Water Pollutants, Chemical"
36328762,-110,diethylstilboestrol,Genetic,Multiple tissue-specific epigenetic alterations regulate persistent gene expression changes following developmental DES exposure in mouse reproductive tissues.,"Clinically, developmental exposure to the endocrine disrupting chemical, diethylstilboestrol (DES), results in long-term male and female infertility. Experimentally, developmental exposure to DES results in abnormal reproductive tract phenotypes in male and female mice. Previously, we reported that neonatal DES exposure causes ERŒ±-mediated aberrations in the transcriptome and in DNA methylation in seminal vesicles (SVs) of adult mice. However, only a subset of DES-altered genes could be explained by changes in DNA methylation. We hypothesized that alterations in histone modification may also contribute to the altered transcriptome during SV development. To test this idea, we performed a series of genome-wide analyses of mouse SVs at pubertal and adult developmental stages in control and DES-exposed wild-type and ERŒ± knockout mice. Neonatal DES exposure altered ERŒ±-mediated mRNA and lncRNA expression in adult SV, including genes encoding chromatin-modifying proteins that can impact histone H3K27ac modification. H3K27ac patterns, particularly at enhancers, and DNA methylation were reprogrammed over time during normal SV development and after DES exposure. Some of these reprogramming changes were ERŒ±-dependent, but others were ERŒ±-independent. A substantial number of DES-altered genes had differential H3K27ac peaks at nearby enhancers. Comparison of gene expression changes, H3K27ac marks and DNA methylation marks between adult SV and adult uterine tissue from ovariectomized mice neonatally exposed to DES revealed that most of the epigenetic changes and altered genes were distinct in the two tissues. These findings indicate that the effects of developmental DES exposure cause reprogramming of reproductive tract tissue differentiation through multiple epigenetic mechanisms.",,"Adverse effects,Covalent protein modification,In vivo,Reactive metabolites,Three-dimensional-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry,Triclosan","Animals,Chromatography, Liquid,Imaging, Three-Dimensional,Mass Spectrometry,Proteins,Proteomics,Rats,Triclosan"

It is well established that genetic susceptibility, obesity, overnutrition and a sedentary life style are risk factors for the development of T2D. However, more recently, studies have also proposed links between exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and altered glucose metabolism. Human exposure to environmental pollutants that are suspected to have endocrine disruptor activity is ubiquitous. One such chemical is Dechlorane Plus (DP), a flame retardant, that is now detected in humans and the environment. Here we show that exposure of mice to low, environmentally relevant doses of DP promoted glucose intolerance in mice fed a high-fat diet independent of weight gain. Furthermore, DP had pronounced effects on the adipose tissue, where it induced the development of hypertrophied white adipose tissue (WAT), and increased serum levels of resistin, leptin, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. In addition, DP exposure induced ""whitening"" of brown adipose tissue (BAT), and reduced BAT uncoupling protein 1 expression. Importantly, some of these effects occurred even when the mice were fed a regular, low-fat, diet. Finally, WAT adipogenic markers were reduced with DP treatment in the WAT. We also show that DP directly inhibited insulin signaling in murine adipocytes and human primary subcutaneous adipocytes in vitro. Taken together, our results show that the exposure to low and environmentally relevant levels of DP may contribute to the development of T2D.","Endocrine Disruptors,Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated,Polycyclic Compounds,dechlorane plus","Cilia beating frequency,Fallopian tube epithelium,Ovary,Oviduct,Ovulation","Animals,Cilia,Epithelium,Fallopian Tubes,Female,Humans,Mice,Ovary,Reproduction"

32481206,-110,chlorpyrifos,Reproductive,TCP structure intensified the chlorpyrifos-induced decrease in testosterone synthesis via LH-LHR-PKA-CREB-Star pathway.,"Similar to diethylphosphate (DEP), 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP) is also a characteristic chemical substance and ultimate transformation product of chlorpyrifos (CPF) because the structure of TCP is equivalent to the trichloro pyridine structure of CPF. TCP is often used as a biomarker of CPF exposure. TCP and DEP are often detected in human blood and urine due to the widespread use of CPF. No studies have sufficiently clarified which structure contributes to the negative effect of CPF on testosterone synthesis. This study aims to explain which structure promotes the inhibitory effect of CPF on testosterone synthesis and the related influence mechanisms. After 20¬†weeks of exposure, the testosterone level in testes was significantly reduced by different doses of CPF (0.3¬†mg/kg body weight CPF and 3.0¬†mg/kg body weight CPF). Meanwhile, the level of testosterone synthesized by isolated primary Leydig cells was also reduced by CPF. In addition, TCP but not DEP aggravated the decrease in testosterone synthesis in isolated primary Leydig cells. On the other hand, CPF and TCP significantly decreased the levels of the Star protein, CREB phosphorylation and PKA phosphorylation, which are important in regulating testosterone synthesis. Based on these results, TCP is a key structure that mediates the CPF-induced decrease in testosterone synthesis by terminating the signal transmission of the LH-LHR-PKA-CREB-Star pathway. Thus, chemicals with the TCP structure may be potential endocrine disruptors that decrease fertility. Chemicals that can be converted to TCP or achieve a trichloro pyridine structure must be considered during reproductive toxicity risk assessment.","Insecticides,Pyridines,Pyridones,Testosterone,Chlorpyrifos","Circadian rhythm,clock genes,melatonin,reproduction,shift-work","Animals,Circadian Clocks,Circadian Rhythm,Female,Humans,Hydrocortisone,Light,Male,Melatonin,Parturition,Photoperiod,Pregnancy,Reproduction,Sleep Disorders, Circadian Rhythm,Suprachiasmatic Nucleus,Time Factors,Work Schedule Tolerance"
34382084,-109,Temephos,Reproductive,Temephos Decreases Sperm Quality and Fertilization Rate and Is Metabolized in Rat Reproductive Tissues at Low-Dose Exposure.,"Temephos is an organophosphorus pesticide used in control campaigns against vectors that transmit diseases, including dengue, a public health concern. The WHO classifies temephos in category III and its safe concentration (low-observable-adverse-effect level) in male rats is 100‚Äâmg/kg/day for up to 44‚Äâdays. Temephos inhibits acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and is metabolized in different tissues, probably by mixed-function oxidases; one of its metabolites is bisphenol S (BPS), which is considered an endocrine disruptor. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of temephos on sperm function and its biotransformation in the testis, epididymis, and other tissues to explore its toxicity in rats treated with 100‚Äâmg/kg/day/5 or 7‚Äâdays (gavage). AChE activity was inhibited 70% starting on day 3 and 13 or 41% mortality was observed at 5 or 7‚Äâdays, respectively. After 7‚Äâdays, temephos significantly decreased sperm motility (30%) and viability (10%) and increased (10%) lipoperoxidation, and the sperm DNA exhibited no damage. Temephos was distributed and metabolized in all tissues, with the highest levels observed in the adipose tissue and temephos levels were 16-fold higher in the epididymis than in the testis. Notably, BPS was observed in the testis. At 5‚Äâdays, decreased sperm motility (12.5%) and viability (5.7%) were observed and sperm fertilization decreased (30%). These results suggest that temephos decreases sperm quality and fertilization capacity at recommended safe concentrations and that it is metabolized in male reproductive tissues. This pesticide places the reproductive health of exposed people at risk, suggesting the need to reevaluate its toxicity.","Organophosphorus Compounds,Pesticides,Acetylcholinesterase,Temefos",,"Animals,Circadian Rhythm,Cricetinae,Female,Immunity,Infertility,Lymphocyte Activation,Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed,Male,Melatonin,Mortality,Neurosecretory Systems,Phodopus,Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins,Reproduction"

33713777,-109,bifenthrin,Reproductive,The deleterious toxic effects of bifenthrin on male fertility.,"Bifenthrin (BF), a broad-spectrum synthetic pyrethroid insecticide, has been generally used to eradicate harmful insects. However, according to the U.S. EPA, BF has been classified as a ""Class C"" carcinogenic ingredient. Furthermore, a previous study reported that BF was considered as endocrine-disrupting chemicals and causes reproductive toxicity in mammals. Despite the various effects of BF, there is a scarcity of studies about its adverse effects on male fertility. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the effects of BF on sperm functions at various concentrations (0.1, 1, 10, and 100‚ÄâŒºM), including a control. Sperm motility and kinematics, capacitation status, intracellular ATP levels, cell viability, PKA activation, and protein tyrosine phosphorylation were measured. Moreover, fertilization and early embryonic development were examined through in vitro fertilization. Results showed that sperm motility and kinematic parameters were significantly decreased at a high BF concentration. Consequently, the sperm capacitation status exhibited significant alteration according to the treatment concentration. Intracellular ATP levels were significantly decreased at 10 and 100‚ÄâŒºM treatment concentrations. Moreover, the levels of phospho-PKA substrates were significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the levels of phospho-tyrosine substrates were significantly decreased at 10 and 100‚ÄâŒºM treatment concentrations. BF treatment also diminished the rate of blastocyst formation. Altogether, our results demonstrated that BF causes detrimental effects on sperm function and can influence fertilization. Therefore, our study results might be helpful in understanding the adverse effects of BF on male fertility.","Insecticides,Pyrethrins,Tyrosine,bifenthrin,Adenosine Triphosphate,Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases","Chronobiology,Circadian system,Pineal gland,SCN/Pineal axis,Suprachiasmatic nuclei","Animals,Circadian Rhythm,Humans,Melatonin,Nervous System Diseases,Pineal Gland,Stress, Psychological,Suprachiasmatic Nucleus"

35803419,-109,nonylphenol,"Hepatic, Cell death",LncRNA PVT1 mediates the progression of liver necroptosis via ZBP1 promoter methylation under nonylphenol exposure.,"Nonylphenol (NP) is one of the most toxic and ubiquitously present endocrine disrupting compounds. Numerous studies have shown that NP exposure induces liver injury, but the interactions between epigenetic factors and necroptosis in this context have not been examined. In this study, rats received daily NP administration (15, 45, and 135 mg/kg/day) via oral gavage over a 28-day period. The upregulation of lncRNA PVT1 was associated with the elevated expression of necroptosis-related proteins (ZBP1, RIPK3, MLKL, and p-MLKL). Moreover, similar effects were also observed after NP exposure in BRL-3A cells. LncRNA PVT1 was predominantly expressed in the nucleus, and ASO was chosen to knock down lncRNA PVT1 in BRL-3A cells. Experimental techniques such as RNA immunoprecipitation, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and co-immunoprecipitation were used to verify direct binding interactions among lncRNA PVT1, EZH2, DNMT1, and ZBP1. The evidence obtained indicated that lncRNA PVT1 could bind to DNMT1 via EZH2 and increase methylation at the ZBP1 promoter, thereby promoting necroptosis. Meanwhile, the demethylation of the highly expressed gene TET1 also promoted ZBP1 upregulation, inducing necroptosis. Taken together, these findings provide valuable insights into the potential molecular mechanisms underlying liver injury in response to NP exposure. Hence, they lay a mechanistic foundation for the evaluation of NP biosafety.","Igf2bp1 protein, rat,Phenols,RNA, Long Noncoding,RNA-Binding Proteins,nonylphenol",,"Animals,Cluster Analysis,GATA6 Transcription Factor,Gene Expression Profiling,Immunohistochemistry,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Proto-Oncogene Proteins,Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor,Sex Cord-Gonadal Stromal Tumors,Signal Transduction,Transforming Growth Factor beta"

The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of subchronic (90 days) oral Cd exposure in daily doses of 0.09-4.5\u2009mg/kg b.w. on the balance of sex hormones by estimating estradiol (E) and progesterone (P) concentrations in the uterus and plasma in comparison with the effects of 17-E. Additionally, the uterine weight, histopathological changes in the uterus and ovaries, the regularity of the estrous cycle, Cd bioaccumulation in uterine tissue, and selected biochemical parameters of oxidative stress were determined. A long period of observation (three and six months following the administration period) was used to assess whether the existing effects are reversible. The lowest dose of Cd caused effects similar to 17-E: an increase of E concentration in the uterus, endometrial epithelium thickness, and disturbed estrous cycle with estrus phase prolongation. The obtained results suggest that Cd causes nonlinear response. Higher doses of Cd caused a significant decrease in E concentration in the uterus and plasma, estrous cycle disturbances, endometrium atrophy, and structural damage in the ovaries. This dose additionally induces lipid peroxidation in the uterine tissues. It is noteworthy that a prolonged time of observation after terminating the exposure showed persistent changes in the concentration of E in uterine tissue, as well as alterations in estrous cycle phases, and an increase in lipid peroxidation in the uterus. Moreover, significant positive correlations between the plasma E concentration and endometrial epithelium thickness in all studied groups were found.

34453847,-109,Di-Isononyl Phthalate,"Immune, Genetic",The Impact of Di-Isononyl Phthalate Exposure on Specialized Epithelial Cells in the Colon.,"Di-isononyl phthalate (DiNP) is a high-molecular-weight phthalate commonly used as a plasticizer for polyvinyl chloride and other end products, such as medical devices and construction materials. Most of our initial exposure to DiNP occurs by ingestion of DiNP-contaminated foods. However, little is known about the effects of DiNP on the colon. Therefore, the goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that DiNP exposure alters immune responses and impacts specialized epithelial cells in the colon. To test this hypothesis, adult female mice were orally dosed with corn-oil vehicle control or doses of DiNP ranging from 20‚Äâ¬µg/kg/d to 200‚Äâmg/kg/d for 10-14‚Äâdays. After the dosing period, mice were euthanized in diestrus, and colon tissues and sera were collected for histological, genomic, and proteomic analysis of various immune factors and specialized epithelial cells. Subacute exposure to DiNP significantly increased protein levels of Ki67 and MUC2, expression of a Paneth cell marker (Lyz1), and estradiol levels in sera compared with control. Gene expression of mucins (Muc1, Muc2, Muc3a, and Muc4), Toll-like receptors (Tlr4 and Tlr5), and specialized epithelial cells (ChgA, Lgr5, Cd24a, and Vil1) were not significantly different between treatment groups and control. Cytokine levels of IL-1RA and CXCL12 were also not significantly different between DiNP treatment groups and control. These data reveal that DiNP exposure increases circulating estradiol levels and gene expression in specialized epithelial cells with immune response capabilities (eg, goblet and Paneth cells) in the mouse colon, which may initiate immune responses to prevent further damage in the colon.","Phthalic Acids,phthalic acid,Diethylhexyl Phthalate","Water pollutants,allergy,autoimmune,hydraulic fracturing,immunotoxicity,influenza","Animals,Complex Mixtures,Endocrine Disruptors,Female,Immunity,Male,Mice,Water Pollutants, Chemical"

However, mechanisms linking developmental phthalate exposures to long-term metabolic effects have not yet been elucidated. We investigated the hypothesis that developmental phthalate exposure has long-lasting impacts on PPAR target gene expression and DNA methylation to influence hepatic metabolic profiles across the life course. We utilized an established longitudinal mouse model of perinatal exposures to diethylhexyl phthalate and diisononyl phthalate, and a mixture of diethylhexyl phthalate+diisononyl phthalate. Exposure was through the diet and spanned from 2 weeks before mating until weaning at postnatal day 21 (PND21). Liver tissue was analyzed from the offspring of exposed and control mice at PND21 and in another cohort of exposed and control mice at 10\u2009months of age. RNA-seq and pathway enrichment analyses indicated that acetyl-CoA metabolic processes were altered in diisononyl phthalate-exposed female livers at both PND21 and 10 months (FDR\u2009=\u20090.0018). Within the pathway, all 13 significant genes were potential PPAR target genes. Promoter DNA methylation was altered at three candidate genes, but persistent effects were only observed for . Targeted metabolomics indicated that phthalate-exposed females had decreased acetyl-CoA at PND21 and increased acetyl-CoA and acylcarnitines at 10 months. Together, our data suggested that perinatal phthalate exposures were associated with short- and long-term activation of PPAR target genes, which manifested as increased fatty acid production in early postnatal life and increased fatty acid oxidation in adulthood.

19884658,-109,diethylstilbestrol,Reproductive,The orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner mediates male infertility induced by diethylstilbestrol in mice.,"Studies in rodents have shown that male sexual function can be disrupted by fetal or neonatal administration of compounds that alter endocrine homeostasis, such as the synthetic nonsteroidal estrogen diethylstilbestrol (DES). Although the molecular basis for this effect remains unknown, estrogen receptors likely play a critical role in mediating DES-induced infertility. Recently, we showed that the orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (Nr0b2), which is both a target gene and a transcriptional repressor of estrogen receptors, controls testicular function by regulating germ cell entry into meiosis and testosterone synthesis. We therefore hypothesized that some of the harmful effects of DES on testes could be mediated through Nr0b2. Here, we present data demonstrating that Nr0b2 deficiency protected mice against the negative effects of DES on testis development and function. During postnatal development, Nr0b2-null mice were resistant to DES-mediated inhibition of germ cell differentiation, which may be the result of interference by Nr0b2 with retinoid signals that control meiosis.

32361967,-109,bisphenol A,Metabolic,Human exposure to bisphenol A through dietary sources and development of diabetes mellitus: a cross-sectional study in Pakistani population.,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is considered as xenoestrogen, a crucial component utilized for the manufacturing of plastic products. It has a potential to disrupt the endocrine system and induces endocrine-related metabolic disorders. We aimed to investigate the exposure of BPA in Pakistani population and its association with sociodemographic features, dietary habits, and risk factors of diabetes mellitus (DM). This cross-sectional study was conducted on 400 participants among which 61.75% participants were diabetic and 38.25% were non-diabetic. We developed a structured questionnaire, gathered sociodemographic data, and collected their urine and blood samples for the estimation of BPA and various biomarkers as risk factors of DM, respectively. Pearson correlation coefficient was determined for urinary BPA levels and DM risk factors. Urinary BPA values were adjusted for confounders. Sociodemographic data shown that urinary BPA level was significantly higher (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05) in obese people (BMI‚Äâ>‚Äâ27) living in semi-urban and industrial areas. BPA was detectable in 75% of study participants. Urinary BPA level was found to be higher in diabetic participants compared with that of non-diabetics. A significant correlation is observed between BPA exposure and DM risk factors. We found that urinary BPA level was correlated with elevated levels of HbA1c (r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.6028), HOMA-IR (r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.5356), CRP (r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.6946), BUN (r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.6077), AST (r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.5151), FFA (r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.5759), TGs (r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.5608), and MDA (r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.6908). Hence, our study adds to the growing body of evidence supporting the role of BPA exposure as a risk factor for DM and may be associated with higher glycemic index, increased pro-inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers, dyslipidemia, and impaired functioning of the liver and kidney. Heating food in plastic containers and consumption of packed food items are the main sources of BPA exposure which are positively associated with DM.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Phenols,bisphenol A","17Œ±-ethinylestradiol,Growth,SHBG,Seahorse,Sexual hormones,VTG","Animals,Contraceptive Agents, Female,Estrogens,Ethinyl Estradiol,Female,Humans,Infant,Male,Smegmamorpha,Vitellogenins"

Although recent studies have shown BPA-induced neurotoxicity, it is far from clear what precisely epigenetic mechanisms are involved in BPA-induced cognitive deficits. In this study, pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells were treated with BPA at 1 ŒºM for 36 h in vitro. In vivo, C57BL/6 mice were administered to BPA at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day for 10 weeks. The results showed that 1 ŒºM BPA exposure for 36 h impaired neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells through decreasing the primary and secondary branches. Besides, BPA exposure decreased the level of Ac-H3K9 (histone H3 Lys9 acetylation) by upregulating the expression of HDAC2 (histone deacetylases 2) in PC12 cells. Furthermore, treatment of both TSA (Trichostatin A, inhibitor of the histone deacetylase) and shHDAC2 plasmid (HDAC2 knockdown construct) resulted in amelioration neurite outgrowth deficits induced by BPA. In addition, it was shown that repression of HDAC2 could markedly rescue the spine density impairment in the hippocampus and prevent the cognitive impairment caused by BPA exposure in mice. Collectively, HDAC2 plays an essential role in BPA-induced neurotoxicity, which provides a potential molecular target for medical intervention.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Environmental Pollutants,Phenols,Hdac2 protein, mouse,Hdac2 protein, rat,Histone Deacetylase 2,bisphenol A","Abnormality,Environment,Heavy metals,Male sheep,Spermatogenesis,Testis","Animals,Copper,Environmental Pollutants,Male,Metals, Heavy,Reproduction,Semen Analysis,Sheep,Spermatozoa,Testis,Testosterone,Toxicity Tests, Chronic,Trace Elements"

Although 2,4-DCP is suspected to have endocrine disruption, the reproductive toxicity of 2,4-DCP in mammals has not been adequately assessed. In the present study, we examined the effect of 2,4-DCP on the fertility of mouse eggs. The data showed that oral administration of 2,4-DCP (180‚Äâmg/kg/day for 7 days) compromises the fertilization rate of mouse oocytes. To further analyze the mechanism by which 2,4-DCP decreases fertilization, the key regulators and events during fertilization of mouse eggs were investigated. We found that the dynamics of cortical granules (CGs) were disrupted by showing the redistribution of CG free domain in 2,4-DCP-administered oocytes. This abnormality perturbed the sperm binding site in the zona pellucida (ZP) and dramatically reduced the number of sperm binding to the ZP of 2,4-DCP-administered oocytes. In addition, the abundance of Juno, a sperm receptor on the egg membrane, was also decreased and its distribution was mislocated in 2,4-DCP-administered oocytes. Finally, we validated that the defects of fertilization participants and events caused by 2,4-DCP might be mediated by the increased level of reactive oxygen species-induced apoptosis of oocytes. Therefore, we demonstrate that 2,4-DCP compromises the fertilization ability of mouse oocytes via inducing oxidative stress.","Chlorophenols,Endocrine Disruptors,Reactive Oxygen Species,Receptors, Cell Surface,folate receptor 4, mouse,2,4-dichlorophenol",,"Animals,Corticosterone,Endocrine System,Environment,Lizards,Male,Phenotype,Rain,Seasons,Sexual Behavior, Animal,Territoriality,Testosterone"

To begin to explore the impact of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) on brain mechanisms of body fluid regulation, both central and systemic VP release in response to acute dehydration were assessed in adult male rats fed the commercial PCB mixture Aroclor 1254 (30 mg/kg/day) for 15 days. Water intake and body weight were recorded daily, and on day 15 rats were dehydrated by intraperitoneal injection of 3.5 M saline (controls received physiological saline) and sacrificed 4-6 h later. Intranuclear VP release was measured in SON tissue punches in vitro, and systemic VP release was measured in the same rats. SON prepared from dehydrated PCB-naive rats released significantly more VP than did SON from control rats (4.9 +/- 0.8 vs. 2.7 +/- 0.4 pg/ml/microg). In contrast, while Aroclor 1254 exposure had no effect on baseline water intake, weight gain, or plasma osmolality responses to dehydration in PCB-fed rats, the SON failed to respond with increased VP release during dehydration. Consistent with previous studies showing an inhibitory effect of central VP on plasma VP output, dehydrated PCB-fed rats had an exaggerated 863% increase in plasma VP over basal levels, compared to a 241% increase in PCB-naive rats, suggesting that the MNC system is subtly disrupted.","Vasopressins,Chlorodiphenyl (54% Chlorine)","Chronic stress,Estradiol,GnRH,Kisspeptin,LH","Animals,Corticosterone,Estradiol,Estrous Cycle,Female,Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone,Hypothalamus,Infertility, Female,Kisspeptins,Luteinizing Hormone,Neurosecretory Systems,Progesterone,Rats,Rats, Wistar,Sexual Behavior, Animal,Stress, Psychological"

Results suggested the hypothesis of a dose-dependent co-action of two mechanisms, namely uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and oxidative stress. These mechanisms respectively matched with opposite effects of hyperstimulation and inhibition of cellular respiration. While uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and oxidative stress have been previously described as separate effects from in vitro BPA exposure using other biochemical endpoints and biological systems, effects of BPB on cellular aerobic respiration are here reported for the first time. Results highlighted a similar hyperstimulation effect after exposure to 5 ¬µg/mL BPA and BPB.

The present study was designed to characterize sex-specific effects of chronic inorganic mercury exposure on toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4 and inflammatory signaling in the liver of prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster). Following 10 weeks of exposure to mercury via drinking water, effects on protein expression levels of TLR2 and TLR4 and the downstream p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) and nuclear factor-kappa (NF-B) signaling pathways were assessed. Using immunoblot analysis, we found that mercury exposure significantly enhanced the expression of TLR4 and activated p38 MAPK and NF-B pathways in vole livers. This is the first report indicating that TLR4 may serve as a sensor for chronic mercury exposure in the liver. Further, compared to females, mercury-treated male voles exhibited significant increases in activated p38 MAPK and a greater extent of liver damage. Together, these findings establish sex-specific liver immunomodulation and cellular signaling following chronic inorganic mercury exposure. Furthermore, this study also supports the use of voles as biomarkers of environmental mercury contamination and offers a promising in vivo tool to test various therapeutic strategies for mercury detoxification.","Environmental Pollutants,NF-kappa B,Tlr2 protein, rat,Tlr4 protein, rat,Toll-Like Receptor 2,Toll-Like Receptor 4,Mercuric Chloride,p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases","Anti-androgenicity,Endocrine disruption,Metabolomics,UV Stabilizer","Animals,Cresols,Female,Male,Oryzias,Reproduction,Ultraviolet Rays,Water Pollutants, Chemical"

However, the exact mechanism was unknown. Among all the endocrine-disrupting chemicals, mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) was a chemical that was most frequently detected in human urine. Our study was performed with the aim of investigating the harmful effects of MnBP on airway epithelial cells (AECs), T cells, and eosinophils by using eosinophilic asthma mouse models. Mice that received OVA with MnBP had higher levels of airway hyperresponsiveness, total and eosinophil cell counts, as well as T cell proliferation and T helper 2 cytokine release than those which only received OVA. Moreover, MnBP contributed to directly enhancing the eosinophilic activation which was shown in. Long-term exposure MnBP activated AECs through the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) pathway, decreased nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression, and increased interleukin-33 expression. Additionally, MnBP can induce human eosinophil activation to release eosinophil extracellular traps (EETs). Taken together, our study suggested the roles of MnBP exposure increase the risk of asthma development and severity. Furthermore, vitamin E treatment (anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects) can reduce MnBP-induced harmful effects through inhibiting EETs, restoring Nrf2, and suppressing the NF-kB pathway.","NF-E2-Related Factor 2,NF-kappa B,Phthalic Acids,Ovalbumin,monobutyl phthalate","8-hydroxy-2‚Ä≤deoxyguanosine,MDA,Rodent bone marrow micronucleus test,comet assay","Animals,Curcuma,DNA Damage,Liver,Malondialdehyde,Rats,Rats, Wistar"

These EDCs can disrupt hormone signaling in the human and animal body systems including the very important hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis causing adverse health effects. Thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) are hormones of the HPT axis which are essential for regulation of metabolism, heart rate, body temperature, growth, development, etc. In this study, potential endocrine-disrupting activity of the most common phthalate plasticizer, DEHP, and emerging non-phthalate alternate plasticizers, DINCH, ATBC, and DEHA against thyroid hormone receptor (TRŒ±) were characterized. The structural binding characterization of indicated ligands was performed against the TRŒ± ligand binding site employing Schrodinger's induced fit docking (IFD) approach. The molecular simulations of interactions of the ligands against the residues lining a TRŒ± binding pocket, including bonding interactions, binding energy, docking score, and IFD score were analyzed. In addition, the structural binding characterization of TRŒ± native ligand, T3, was also done for comparative analysis. The results revealed that all ligands were placed stably in the TRŒ± ligand-binding pocket. The binding energy values were highest for DINCH, followed by ATBC, and were higher than the values estimated for TRŒ± native ligand, T3, whereas the values for DEHA and DEHP were similar and comparable to that of T3.

Testicular stem cells include relatively quiescent, very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs), and actively dividing spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). Both VSELs and SSCs express estrogen receptors and are directly vulnerable to endocrine disruption. Exposing mice pups to estradiol (20¬†Œºg/pup/day on days 5-7) or diethylstilbestrol (2¬†Œºg/pup/day on days 1-5) affected spermatogenesis during adult life with reduced numbers of tubules in stage VIII, tetraploid cells and sperm. These mice were infertile and majority of diethylstilbestrol treated mice revealed testicular cancer-like changes. An increase in VSEL numbers, observed by both flow cytometry and qRT-PCR, was associated with marked reduction of c-KIT positive spermatogonial cells. VSELs undergo epigenetic changes due to endocrine disruption that results in blocked differentiation (impaired¬†spermatogenesis) leading to reduced sperm count and infertility, and their excessive self-renewal initiates cancer-like changes in adult life. Thus, testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS) has a stem cell rather than a genetic basis.",Endocrine Disruptors,,"Animals,Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System,Heart,Humans,Myocardium,Xenobiotics"
36181646,-108,,,Bisphenol A: Potential Factor of Miscarriage in Women in the Context of the Phenomenon of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps.,"Humans are exposed to a number of environmental pollutants every day. Among them, endocrine disruptors are particularly harmful to human health. Bisphenol A (BPA) is a xenoestrogen that has been shown to disrupt the endocrine system and cause reproductive toxicity. In this study, we aimed to verify the potential relationship between BPA and miscarriage involving the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Blood samples were collected from healthy women and women who had miscarriage in the first trimester of pregnancy. The serum levels of cytoplasmic anti-PR3 antibody and perinuclear anti-MPO antibody were determined using an immunoenzymatic method. The concentrations of key proinflammatory proteins TNF-Œ± and MCP-1, as well as NADPH oxidase subunits NOX1 and NCF2, were also measured in the serum samples. The serum concentration of BPA was determined using gas chromatography. The results showed that the concentrations of BPA were significantly elevated in the serum of women who had miscarriage compared to the control group, with the highest concentration found in the ""NETs-positive"" group. The levels of MCP-1 and TNF-Œ± were significantly higher in the ""NETs-positive"" group compared to the ""NETs-negative"" and control group. The levels of NOX1 and NCF2 were also higher in the ""NETs-positive"" group compared to the ""NETs-negative"" group. The study showed that BPA could play a role in the course of miscarriage through the formation of NETs. The results indicate the need to limit the exposure of women planning pregnancy to xenoestrogens, including BPA.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Pollutants,Phenols,Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha,NADPH Oxidases,bisphenol A",,"Animals,Cytokines,Disease Models, Animal,Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Pollutants,Female,Humans,Mice,Physical Conditioning, Animal,Polychlorinated Biphenyls,Skin,Wound Healing"

The early-transformed triple-negative human mammary MCF10AT1 cells were chronically (60 days) exposed to low doses (10 M) of Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), a genotoxic agent, and/or Bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine disruptor. Our study revealed that exposed MCF10AT1 cells developed, in a time-dependent manner, an acquired phenotype characterized by an increase in cancerous properties (anchorage independent growth and stem-like phenotype). Co-exposure of MCF10AT1 cells to B[a]P and BPA led to a significantly greater aggressive phenotype compared to B[a]P or BPA alone. This study provided new insights into the existence of a functional interplay between the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and the G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30) by which chronic and low-dose exposure of B[a]P and/or BPA fosters the progression of MCF10AT1 cells into a more aggressive substage. Experiments using AhR or GPR30 antagonists, siRNA strategies, and RNAseq analysis led us to propose a model in which AhR signaling plays a ""driver role"" in the AhR/GPR30 cross-talk in mediating long-term and low-dose exposure of B[a]P and/or BPA. Retrospective analysis of two independent breast cancer cohorts revealed that the  mRNA expression signature resulted in poor breast cancer prognosis, in particular in the ER-negative and the triple-negative subtypes. Finally, the study identified targeting AhR and/or GPR30 with specific antagonists as a strategy capable of inhibiting carcinogenesis associated with chronic exposure to low doses of B[a]P and BPA in MCF10AT1 cells. Altogether, our results indicate that the engagement of both AhR and GPR30 functions, in particular in an ER-negative/triple-negative context of breast cells, favors tumor progression and leads to poor prognosis.'}",,,"Animals,Cytosol,Gene Expression Regulation,Rats,Sulfotransferases"

Therefore, we investigated if maternal OPFR exposure altered adult offspring feeding, locomotor, and anxiety-like behaviors on a low-fat (LFD) or high-fat diet (HFD). Wild-type C57Bl/6J dams were orally dosed with vehicle (sesame oil) or an OPFR mixture (1 mg/kg combination each of tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate, triphenyl phosphate and tricresyl phosphate) from gestation day 7 to postnatal day 14. After weaning, pups were fed either a LFD or HFD until 19 weeks of age. Locomotor and anxiety-like behaviors were evaluated with the open field test, elevated plus maze, and metabolic cages. Feeding behaviors and meal patterns were analyzed by a Biological Data Acquisition System. Anogenital distance was reduced in OPFR-exposed male pups, but no effect was detected on adult body weight. We observed interactions of OPFR exposure and HFD consumption on locomotor and anxiety-like behavior in males, suggesting an anxiogenic effect while reducing overall nighttime activity. We also observed an interaction of OPFR exposure and HFD on weekly food intake and feeding behaviors. OPFR-exposed males consumed more total HFD than oil-exposed males during the 72-hour trial. However, when arcuate gene expression was analyzed, OPFR exposure induced Agrp expression in females, which would suggest greater orexigenic tone. Collectively, the implications of our study are that the behavioral effects of OPFR exposure are modulated by adult HFD consumption, which may influence the metabolic and neurological consequences of maternal OPFR exposure.","Flame Retardants,Organophosphates",,"Animals,Daphnia,Ivermectin,Molting,Transcriptome,Water Pollutants, Chemical,gamma-Aminobutyric Acid"
31394344,-108,,,Bisphenol A increases intestinal permeability through disrupting intestinal barrier function in mice.,"That an alteration of the intestinal permeability is associated with gut barrier function has been increasingly evident, which plays an important role in human and animal health. Bisphenol A (BPA), an industrial compound used worldwide, has recently been classified as an environmental pollutant. One of our earlier studies has demonstrated that BPA disrupts the intestinal barrier function by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting cell proliferation in the human colonic epithelial cells line. In this study, we investigated the effects of dietary BPA uptake on the colonic barrier function in mice, as well as the intestinal permeability. Dietary BPA uptake was observed to destroy the morphology of the colonic epithelium and increase the pathology score. The levels of endotoxin, diamine peroxidase, D-lactate, and zonulin were found to have been significantly elevated in both plasma and colonic mucosa. A decline in the number of intestinal goblet cells and in mucin 2 gene expression was observed in the mice belonging to the BPA group. The results of immunohistochemistry revealed that the expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1) in colonic epithelium of BPA mice decreased significantly, and their gene abundance was also inhibited. Moreover, dietary BPA uptake was also found to have significantly reduced colonic microbial diversity and altered microbial structural composition. The functional profiles of colonic bacterial community exhibited adverse effects of dietary BPA intake on the endocrine and digestive systems, as well as the transport and catabolism functions. Collectively, our study highlighted that dietary BPA increased the colonic permeability, and this effect was closely related to the disruption of intestinal chemistry and physical and biological barrier functions.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Hazardous Substances,MUC2 protein, human,Mucin-2,Occludin,Phenols,bisphenol A",,"Animals,Depression,Humans,Neuronal Plasticity,Sleep Deprivation,Sleep Wake Disorders"

36088992,-108,,,Exploring the relationship between blood toxic metal(oid)s and serum insulin levels through benchmark modelling of human data: Possible role of arsenic as a metabolic disruptor.,"The major goal of this study was to estimate the correlations and dose-response pattern between the measured blood toxic metals (cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni))/metalloid (arsenic (As)) and serum insulin level by conducting Benchmark dose (BMD) analysis of human data. The study involved 435 non-occupationally exposed individuals (217 men and 218 women). The samples were collected at health care institutions in Belgrade, Serbia, from January 2019 to May 2021. Blood sample preparation was conducted by microwave digestion. Cd was measured by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry (GF-AAS), while inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to measure Hg, Ni, Cr and As. BMD analysis of insulin levels represented as quantal data was done using the PROAST software version 70.1 (model averaging methodology, BMD response: 10%). In the male population, there was no correlation between toxic metal/metalloid concentrations and insulin level. However, in the female population/whole population, a high positive correlation for As and Hg, and a strong negative correlation for Ni and measured serum insulin level was established. BMD modelling revealed quantitative associations between blood toxic metal/metalloid concentrations and serum insulin levels. All the estimated BMD intervals were wide except the one for As, reflecting a high degree of confidence in the estimations and possible role of As as a metabolic disruptor. These results indicate that, in the case of As blood concentrations, even values higher than BMD (BMDL): 3.27 (1.26) (male population), 2.79 (0.771) (female population), or 1.18 (2.96) Œºg/L (whole population) might contribute to a 10% higher risk of insulin level alterations, meaning 10% higher risk of blood insulin increasing from within reference range to above reference range. The obtained results contribute to the current body of knowledge on the use of BMD modelling for analysing human data.","Insulins,Cadmium,Chromium,Graphite,Nickel,Mercury,Arsenic",,"Animals,Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental,Islets of Langerhans,Male,Microscopy, Electron,Rats,Rats, Inbred Strains"

BALB/c mice, (6 weeks old, female) were orally given either OVA (OVA-fed) or water (Water-fed), immunized intraperitoneally with OVA and injected with either BPA in corn oil or the vehicle alone. After subsequent 2nd immunization, serum titers of total IgE, OVA-specific IgE, IgG, IgG1 IgG2a and ability of their splenocytes for production of interferon (IFN) -gamma, interleukin (IL) -4 and IL-12 were examined by ELISA. Lymphocyte proliferation assay against concanavalin A (Con A) or OVA was also performed for 3H-Thymidine incorporation. In Water-fed groups, treatment with BPA resulted in lower titers of total IgE (P<0.01) and higher levels IgG2a (P<0.05) followed by a higher IFN-gamma (P<0.05) and IL-12 (P<0.05) with an intact IL-4. When OVA-fed groups were examined, the compound did not change production of total and OVA-specific IgE and -IgG2a but resulted in lower production of IFN-gamma (P<0.05). Also, BPA resulted in impaired lymphocyte proliferation to Con A in Water-fed groups (P<0.05) but not in tolerated animals.

DEHP exposure at the prepubertal stage may lead to extensive testicular injury. However, the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we gavaged male C57BL/6 mice with different concentrations of DEHP (0, 250, and 500¬†mg/kg-bw¬∑d) from postnatal day 22-35, and exposed TM3 Leydig cells with 0, 100, 200, 300, and 400¬†ŒºM of MEHP (bioactive metabolite of DEHP) for 12-48¬†h. RNA sequencing was performed both in testicular tissue and TM3 cells. The results showed that DEHP disrupts testicular development and reduces serum testosterone levels in male prepubertal mice. Bioinformatic analysis and experimental verification have revealed that DEHP/MEHP induces cell cycle arrest in TM3 cells and increases apoptosis both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, the p53 signaling pathway was found to be activated upon DEHP/MEHP treatment. The inhibition of p53 by pifithrin-Œ± significantly reduced MEHP-induced injuries in TM3 cells. Cumulatively, these findings revealed the involvement of the p53 signaling pathway in DEHP-induced prepubertal testicular injury by promoting cell apoptosis and inhibiting cell proliferation of Leydig cells.","Tumor Suppressor Protein p53,Diethylhexyl Phthalate",,"Animals,Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2,Endocrine Glands,Hazardous Substances,Humans,Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System,Occupational Diseases,Occupational Exposure"

This study aimed to evaluate the subacute effects of TBT on the HPT axis of male and female rats. A dose of 100¬†ng/kg/day TBT was used in both sexes over a 15-day period, and the morphophysiology and gene expression of the HPT axis were assessed. TBT exposure increased the body weight in both sexes, while food efficiency increased - only in male rats. It was also possible to note alterations in the thyroid, with the presence of a stratified epithelium, cystic degeneration, and increased interstitial collagen deposition. A reduction in T3 and T4 levels was only observed in TBT male rats. A reduction in TSH levels was observed in TBT female rats. Evaluating mRNA expression, we observed a decrease in hepatic D1 and TRH mRNA levels in TBT female rats. An increase in D2 mRNA expression in the hypothalamus was observed in TBT male rats. Additionally, no significant changes in TRH or hepatic D1 mRNA expression in TBT male rats or in hypothalamic D1 and D2 mRNA expression in TBT female rats were observed. Thus, we can conclude that TBT has different toxicological effects on male and female rats by altering thyroid gland morphophysiology, leading to abnormal HPT axis function, and even at subacute and low doses, it may be involved in complex endocrine and metabolic disorders.","Trialkyltin Compounds,tributyltin","developmental/perinatal programming,diabetes,high-fat diet,intergenerational effects,maternal and paternal overnutrition,obesity","Animals,Diabetes Mellitus,Diet, High-Fat,Female,Male,Paternal Exposure,Pregnancy,Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects,Rats,Rats, Wistar,Risk"

Little is known about environmental factors that may modulate risk in genetically susceptible populations. Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are known endocrine disruptors and, given the interplay between the endocrine and immune systems, are plausible contributors to celiac disease. The current study aims to elucidate the association between POPs and celiac disease. We conducted a single-site pilot study of 88 patients recruited from NYU Langone's Hassenfeld Children's Hospital outpatient clinic, 30 of which were subsequently diagnosed with celiac disease using standard serology and duodenal biopsy examination.

The fitting equation was y=90.065x+1466.7, and the inhibition kinetic parameter (K) was 16.28 ¬µM.  extrapolation (IVIVE) showed that the threshold concentration of 2,4,6-TBP to induce inhibition of SULT1A3 was 1.628 ¬µM.  docking, the method utilized indicated that more hydrogen bonds formation contributed to the stronger inhibition of 3,5-DBP than 3-BP. In conclusion, our study gave the full description of the inhibition of BPs towards four SULT isoforms, which may provide a new perspective on the toxicity mechanism of BPs and further explain the interference of BPs on endocrine hormone metabolism.""}","Environmental Pollutants,Hormones,Protein Isoforms,Sulfotransferases","ADHD,Anxiety,Autism,High-fat diet,Maternal obesity,Pregnancy,Programming,Schizophrenia","Animals,Diet, High-Fat,Female,Humans,Neurodevelopmental Disorders,Obesity,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Complications,Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects"

35231543,-107,,,Bisphenol A damages testicular junctional proteins transgenerationally in mice.,"Testicular junctions are pivotal to male fertility and regulated by constituent proteins. Increasing evidence suggests that environmental chemicals, including bisphenol A (BPA), may impact these proteins, but whether the impacts persist for generations is not yet known. Here, we investigate the effect of BPA (a ubiquitous endocrine-disrupting chemical) on testis and sperm functions and whether the effects are transferred to subsequent generations. Male mice (F0) were exposed to corn oil (Control) or 5 or 50¬†mg BPA/kg body weight/day from 6 to 12 weeks of age. The F0 were mated with wild-type females to produce the first filial (F1) generation. F2 and F3 were produced using similar procedures. Our results showed that BPA doses decreased the levels of some junctional proteins partly via binding with estrogen receptors (ERŒ± and ErŒ≤), upregulation of p-ERK1/2, P85, p-JNK and activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. Consequently, testicular histological abnormalities, disrupted spermatogenesis, decreased sperm count, and inability to fertilize eggs were observed in mice exposed to BPA. These effects were transferred to successive generations (F2), partly through DNA methylation, but mostly alleviated in F3 males. Our findings suggest that paternal exposure to chemicals promoting alteration of testicular junctional proteins and its transgenerational inheritance is a key component of the origin of male reproductive health problems.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Phenols,bisphenol A","Chemical ecology,comparative biology,corticosteroid-binding globulin,cortisol,glucocorticoids,herbivory,phytochemicals,plant-herbivore interactions,secondary plant compounds","Animals,Diet,Herbivory,Phytochemicals,Plants,Vertebrates"

Phthalates and bisphenol-A (BPA), two endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), may affect the human endocrine system. In this study, we aimed to perform a comprehensive investigation of whether growth hormone, thyroid function, and EDCs exhibited differential levels between ADHD patients and healthy controls. In total, 144 children with ADHD and 70 healthy control subjects were enrolled. Their endocrine systems were evaluated using the serum levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), and Free T4. The urinary levels of EDCs, including monoethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-methyl phthalate (MMP), monoethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), and BPA, were also examined. Patients with ADHD had lower IGF-1 levels than healthy controls (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.003), but we observed no significant difference in IGFBP-3, TSH, T3, T4, or Free T4. Compared to the control group, patients with ADHD demonstrated higher MEHP levels (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.043), MnBP (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.033), and MBzP (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.040). Furthermore, MEHP levels (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001) and BPA levels (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.041) were negatively correlated with IGF-1 levels, while IGF-1 levels were negatively correlated with principal components consisting of ADHD clinical symptoms and neuropsychological performance variables.

A total of 112 pregnant women (60 with GDM and 52 healthy women) were included in this case-control study. Analysis of heavy metals and trace elements were performed in inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. Heavy metals (cadmium, lead, antimony, mercury, and arsenic), trace elements (chromium-III, chromium-VI, zinc, copper, and selenium), and metabolic parameters were assessed in both groups. It was determined that the levels of cadmium, lead, antimony, and copper were higher (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05) and levels of chromium-III, zinc, and selenium were lower (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05) among the GDM group compared to the control group, whereas there was a statistically insignificant difference between the two groups, regarding the levels of copper, mercury, and arsenic (p‚Äâ>‚Äâ0.05).

The toxicoepigenetic mechanisms of developmental exposure to common EDCs, such as bisphenol A (BPA), are poorly known. The present study aimed to evaluate associations between perinatal maternal urinary concentrations of BPA, bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol F (BPF) and LINE-1 (long interspersed nuclear elements) and Alu (short interspersed nuclear elements, SINEs) DNA methylation levels in newborns, as surrogate markers of global DNA methylation. Data come from 318 mother-child pairs of the `Nutrition in Early Life and Asthma¬¥ (NELA) birth cohort. Urinary bisphenol concentration was measured by dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction and ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection. DNA methylation was quantitatively assessed by bisulphite pyrosequencing on 3 LINEs and 5 SINEs. Unadjusted linear regression analyses showed that higher concentration of maternal urinary BPA in 24th week's pregnancy was associated with an increase in LINE-1 methylation in all newborns (p = 0.01) and, particularly, in male newborns (p = 0.03). These associations remained in full adjusted models [beta = 0.09 (95 % CI = 0.03; 0.14) for all newborns; and beta = 0.10 (95 % CI = 0.03; 0.17) for males], including a non-linear association for female newborns as well (p-trend = 0.003). No associations were found between maternal concentrations of bisphenol and Alu sequences. Our results suggest that exposure to environmental levels of BPA may be associated with a modest increase in LINE-1 methylation -as a relevant marker of epigenomic stability- during human fetal development. However, any effects on global DNA methylation are likely to be small, and of uncertain biological significance.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Phenols,bisphenol A","Endocrine disruptor,Health effects,Insulin-like growth factor","Animals,Dioxins,Endocrine Disruptors,Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers,Humans,Reproducibility of Results,Somatomedins"

Endocrine-disrupting impacts of these chemicals have been demonstrated in in vitro studies, rodent toxicology studies, and some human observational studies. Here we compared urinary concentrations of triclosan and BPA in the Canadian and U.S. populations using nationally-representative data from the 2012-2015 Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) and the 2013-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We then examined the cross-sectional associations of urinary triclosan or BPA with serum sex steroid hormones, including estradiol (E2), progesterone (P4), and testosterone (T), using multivariable regression. We observed differences in creatinine-standardized chemical concentrations between countries; urinary triclosan was higher in Canadian females aged 12-19¬†years, while BPA was higher in U.S. females aged 20-49¬†years. We also found significant associations among urinary chemicals and serum E2 and T, but not P4. Increasing triclosan was associated with higher levels of E2 in 6-11-year-old girls, but with lower levels of E2 and T in adolescent boys aged 12-19¬†years. Increasing BPA was associated with lower levels of E2 in 6-11-year-old boys and in adolescents aged 12-19¬†years of either sex. We observed a U-shaped association between urinary triclosan and E2 in male adults aged 50-79¬†years; no associations between BPA and hormones were detected in adults. These results, in accordance with the in vitro and animal literature, suggest that triclosan and BPA exposures may be cross-sectionally associated with altered reproductive hormone levels, especially in children and adolescents. Further research and prospective studies are necessary to elucidate country-specific differences in chemical exposures and the potential public health significance of these findings.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Gonadal Steroid Hormones,Phenols,Triclosan,bisphenol A",,"Animals,Disease Management,Disruptive, Impulse Control, and Conduct Disorders,Dopamine Agonists,Humans,Hyperprolactinemia"

Colas, a sweetened carbonated drink are most common caramel coloured beverage and its consumption is linked with diabetes, obesity, pancreatic cancer and other endocrine disorders. A major by-product produced during caramelization is 4-methylimidazole (4-MEI) that is detected in noteworthy concentrations in colas and other beverages. Previous studies revealed the neurotoxic and carcinogenic potential of 4-MEI in animals at higher doses but the effect of 4-MEI at theoretical maximum daily intake dose on glucose homeostasis is unexplored. Here, mice treated with 4-MEI (32‚Äâ¬µg/kg bodyweight/day) for seven weeks exhibited severe hypoglycaemia and hyperinsulinemia mediated by hyperplasia of pancreatic beta cells and induces metabolic alterations. On combinatorial treatment, 4-MEI suppressed the glucogenic potential of non-artificial sweeteners and promotes lipogenesis. Furthermore, increased levels of C-peptide, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides were observed in the humans with regular intake of 4-MEI containing beverages. In summary, 4-MEI induced pancreatic beta cell hyperplasia and leads to disruption of glucose and lipid homeostasis. This study suggests the need for further assessment and reconsideration of the wide usage of 4-MEI containing caramels as food additives.","Blood Glucose,Food Coloring Agents,Imidazoles,Insulin,4-methylimidazole",,"Animals,Disease Models, Animal,Edible Grain,Environmental Exposure,Food Microbiology,Fusarium,Gastroenteritis,Gastrointestinal Tract,Humans,Male,Mice,Ribosomes,Risk Assessment,Signal Transduction,Swine,Translational Research, Biomedical,Trichothecenes"

Using the same mixture consisting of 1 mg/kg/day of each triphenyl phosphate, tricresyl phosphate, and tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate, the current study aimed to identify the role of estrogen receptor alpha (ERŒ±) in OPFR-induced disruption, utilizing ERŒ± knockout (ERŒ±KO) mice fed either a low-fat diet (LFD) or high-fat diet (HFD). Body weight and composition, food intake patterns, glucose and insulin tolerance, circulating peptide hormones, and expression of hypothalamic genes associated with energy homeostasis were measured. When fed HFD, no marked direct effects of OPFR were observed in mice lacking ERŒ±, suggesting a role for ERŒ± in generating previously reported wildtype (WT) findings. Male ERŒ±KO mice fed LFD experienced decreased feeding efficiency and altered insulin tolerance, whereas their female counterparts displayed less fat mass and circulating ghrelin when exposed to OPFRs. These effects were not noted in the previous WT study, indicating that loss of ERŒ± may sensitize animals fed LFD to alternate pathways of endocrine disruption by OFPRs. Collectively, these data demonstrate both direct and indirect actions of OPFRs on ERŒ±-mediated pathways governing energy homeostasis and support a growing body of evidence urging concern for risk of human exposure.","Estrogen Receptor alpha,Flame Retardants,Insulin,Organophosphates","Endometriosis,Environment,HPA,Stress","Animals,Disease Models, Animal,Endometriosis,Female,Humans,Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System,Pituitary-Adrenal System,Stress, Psychological"

Prepuberal exposure to DEHP leads to steroidogenesis disorders. However, the specific mechanism remains ambiguous. Therefore, Sprague Dawley (SD) rats underwent prepuberal DEHP exposure at a dose of 500 mg/kg per day through gavage. Additionally, the resulting testicular injury was evaluated to confirm the disturbed steroidogenesis. Changes in testicular histology, significant reduction of serum testosterone (P < 0.01) and luteinizing hormone (P < 0.001), and significantly decreased expressions of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (P < 0.01) and 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (P < 0.05) were found in DEHP-treated rats. DEHP exposure resulted in obvious intestinal damage and oxidative stress imbalance, primarily in the jejunum. Both the activation of the nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway and alterations of microbiota profiles were observed in all three gut specimens, but were most notable in the jejunum. We hypothesize that the gut-microbiota-testis axis, which is mediated by the activation of the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway, could be involved in the dysfunction of prepuberal steroidogenesis induced by DEHP.","Antioxidants,NF-E2-Related Factor 2,Phthalic Acids,phthalic acid,Diethylhexyl Phthalate","Antifouling biocides,Assiminea grayana,Microplastics,Paint flakes,Reproductive disorder,Snails","Animals,Disinfectants,Environmental Monitoring,Female,Germany,Male,North Sea,Paint,Reproduction,Snails,Time Factors,Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Of these, Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is the most commonly used, with high human exposure occurring as early as the fetal developmental stage and affecting the endocrine system. We focused on the perinatal DEHP effects on pituitary estrogen receptor (ER) expression in male rats, explored their impact on lactotroph and somatotroph cell growth, and evaluated the direct effects of this phthalate on pituitary cell cultures. Our results showed that DEHP perinatal exposure was unable to modify the ERŒ±+ pituitary cell number from prepuberal rats, but increased ERŒ≤+ cells. In adulthood, the pituitary ERŒ±+ cells underwent a slight decrease with ERŒ≤ showing the greatest changes, and with a significant increase observed in somatotroph cells. Also, in vitro, DEHP reduced the ERŒ±+ cells, increased the percentage of ERŒ≤+ pituitary cells and modified the Ki67 index, as well as decreasing the lactotrophs and increasing the somatotroph cells. In conclusion, the present study showed that DEHP induced ER expression changes in normal pituitary glands from male rats in in vivo and in vitro conditions, suggesting that DEHP could differentially modulate lactotroph and somatotroph cell growth, possibly as a consequence of ER imbalance.","Endocrine Disruptors,Receptors, Estrogen,Diethylhexyl Phthalate","environment,epigenetic inheritance,intergenerational transmission,pediatric and adult cancer,pesticide","Animals,DNA Methylation,Endocrine Disruptors,Epigenesis, Genetic,Inheritance Patterns,Neoplasms,Pesticides"

PCM regulates GRP78 by affecting the level of hormones, and there is a regulatory relationship between the UPR, the circRNAs and the miRNAs. In vivo experiments, PCM (suspended in soybean oil) was orally administered to adolescent female mice for 21 days in 3 different doses of 50\xa0mg\xa0kg day (low dose), 100\xa0mg\xa0kg day (medium dose) and 200\xa0mg\xa0kg day (high dose) to cause ovaries and uteruses damage, and in vitro experiments, various doses of PCM from 0.33\xa0√ó\xa010 (low dose) to 1\xa0√ó\xa010 (medium dose) then 3\xa0√ó\xa010 M (high dose) were used to induce injury on the ovaries and uteri of the mice.

D4 is widely used in detergent products, cosmetics, and personal care products. Recently, robust toxicological data for D4 has been reported, but the adverse effects of D4 on brain development are unknown. Here, pregnant mice on gestational day 9.5 were treated daily with D4 to postnatal day 28, and the offspring mice were studied. The prenatal D4-treated mice exhibited cognitive dysfunction, limited memory, and motor learning defect. Moreover, prenatal D4 exposure reduced the proliferation of neuronal progenitors in the offspring mouse brain. Next, the mechanisms through which D4 regulated the cell cycle were investigated. Aberrant gene expression, such as cyclin-dependent kinases CDK6 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27, were found in the prenatal D4-treated mice. Furthermore, the estrogen receptors ERa and ERb were increased in the brain of prenatal D4-treated mice. Overall, these findings suggest that D4 exerts estrogen activity that affects the cell cycle progression of neuronal progenitor cells during neurodevelopment, which may be associated with cognitive deficits in offspring.","Cell Cycle Proteins,Endocrine Disruptors,SOXB1 Transcription Factors,Siloxanes,Sox1 protein, mouse,Green Fluorescent Proteins,octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane",,"Animals,Dronabinol,Female,Kinetics,Lactation,Pregnancy,Prolactin,Rats"

In this study, we aimed at comparing the in vitro impact of these bisphenols from 0.05 to 50,000‚ÄØnM on Th17 differentiation, frequency and function in mouse systemic and intestinal immune T cells and in human blood T cells. This study reports the ability of these bisphenols, at low and environmentally relevant concentration, i.e, 0.05‚ÄØnM, to increase significantly IL-17 production in mouse T cells but not in human T lymphocytes. The use of an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) specific inhibitor demonstrated its involvement in this bisphenol-induced IL-17 production. We also observed an increased IL-17 secretion by BPS and BPF, and not by BPA, in mouse naive T cells undergoing in vitro Th17 differentiation.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between urinary CPs and TC risk in Chinese population. From June 2017 to September 2019, a total of 297 histologically confirmed TC cases were recruited. Age- and gender-matched controls were enrolled at the same time. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to determine the levels of three CPs in urine. Conditional logistic regression models were adopted to assess the potential association.

In contrast, experimental designs scrutinizing this question mostly consider the gestational/lactational period, select high unrealistic doses and, have rarely investigated the possible reproductive consequences in the progeny. The present study aimed at assessing comparatively a set of male reproductive endpoints according to exposure windows, gestational/lactational versus pre-pubertal to adulthood, using low doses of endocrine active substances in male rats as well as their unexposed male progeny. Animals were orally exposed to 1¬†mg/kg¬†bw/d of genistein and/or vinclozolin, from conception to weaning or from prepuberty to young adulthood. A number of reproductive endpoints were assessed as well as testicular mRNA expression profiles, in the exposed rats and their unexposed progeny. Overall, the low dosage used only affected weakly most of classical reproductive endpoints. However, the gestational/lactational exposure to vinclozolin alone or combined to genistein significantly delayed the puberty onset. Contrasting with the gestational/lactational exposure, a decreased sperm production was found in the animals exposed to genistein and vinclozolin from the pre-pubertal period but also in their progeny for vinclozolin and the mixture. The expression level of several genes involved in meiosis, apoptosis and steroidogenesis was also affected differentially as a function of the exposure window in both exposed rats and unexposed offspring. We also provide further evidence that doses of endocrine active substances relevant with human exposure may affect the male reproductive phenotype and testicular transcriptome in the exposed generation as well as in the indirectly exposed offspring.","Oxazoles,Genistein,vinclozolin","contaminants of emerging concern,hazard index,risk ranking,seafood,self-organizing maps","Animals,Ecosystem,Europe,Food Contamination,Humans,Neural Networks, Computer,Seafood,Water Pollutants, Chemical"

In the present study, we aimed to estimate the impact of GLP1R agonist on di(2 ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP)-induced atherosclerosis. For this purpose, the effects of GLP1R agonist on various atherogenesis-related cellular processes and pathways were assessed in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). DEHP-induced cell proliferation and migration were significantly decreased by GLP1R agonist in VSMCs. Protein levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 were significantly decreased in cells exposed to GLP1R agonist, compared with DEHP-treated cells. Expression levels of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 were also reduced in GLP1R agonist-treated cells. Similarly, DEHP-associated phosphorylation of protein kinase B and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 was decreased in GLP1R agonist-treated cells, compared with DEHP-treated cells. Our findings suggest that treatment with GLP1R agonist counteracts the activation of pathways related to atherosclerosis.","Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor,ICAM1 protein, rat,Incretins,Plasticizers,Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1,Diethylhexyl Phthalate,Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3","glyphosate,herbicide,mussel,vitellogenin","Animals,Ecosystem,Female,Glycine,Herbicides,Male,Mytilus,Vitellogenins,Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Adult male albino rats were treated orally with DBP at doses of 0, 200, 400, or 600 mg/kg/day for 15 consecutive days. Testicular weight, sperm count, and motility were significantly decreased. Treatment with DBP decreased serum follicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone levels and testicular lactate dehydrogenase activity. DBP treatment also decreased serum total antioxidant capacity and the activities of the testicular antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione reductase. Further, DBP treatment provoked degeneration with absence of spermatogenesis and sperms and necrosis in some of seminiferous tubules. These results indicated that oxidative stress and subsequent decrease in testosterone secretion were the potential underlying mechanism of DBP-induced testicular toxicity.","Biomarkers,Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Pollutants,Plasticizers,Dibutyl Phthalate,Testosterone,Follicle Stimulating Hormone,Oxidoreductases","Japanese medaka,endocrine disrupting effects,graphene oxide,interrenal gland","Animals,Ecosystem,Female,Graphite,Interrenal Gland,Larva,Male,Oryzias,Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Then, they were treated with different concentrations of BPA (i.e., 0, 0.5, 50, or 5000‚ÄØŒºg/kg¬∑bw/day of BPA as the control, low-, medium- and high-exposed group) from postnatal days 7 to 21. Y-maze tests, Golgi-Cox assays and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) were performed to test the changes of learning and memory ability, hippocampal neuromorphology and neurotransmitter levels, respectively. The results showed that the BPA-exposed rats, especially the low- and high-exposed rats, needed more trials and longer times to qualify for the learned criterion than the control rats. Additionally, rats after low- or high-exposure to BPA exhibited decreased DG dendritic complexity and reduced CA1 and DG dendritic spine densities in the hippocampus. Low-dosage BPA treatment could significantly alter the neurotransmitter contents in the hippocampus. In male rats, the levels of glutamic acid (Glu) and acetylcholine increased, while the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and Œ≥-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels decreased, which lead to an unbalanced Glu/GABA ratio. However, in female rats, only 5-HT levels decreased. In conclusion, postnatal exposure to BPA could sex- and dose-dependently disrupt dendritic development and neurotransmitter homeostasis in the rat hippocampus. The impaired spatial learning and memory ability of rats induced by low-dose BPA is associated with both disrupted dendritic development and neurotransmitter homeostasis in the hippocampus.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Neurotransmitter Agents,Phenols,bisphenol A","distribution,hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers,mass spectrometry,toxicity","Animals,Ecotoxicology,Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Pollutants,Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry,Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers,Humans,Hydroxylation,Mass Spectrometry"

However, whether triphenyltin interferes with the adrenal glands during puberty remains unknown. Here, we reported the effects of triphenyltin on the adrenal glands in rats. Male Sprague Dawley rats (age of 35 days) were orally administered with 0, 0.5, 1, or 2¬†mg/kg/day triphenyltin for 18 days. Triphenyltin significantly lowered corticosterone levels at 1 and 2¬†mg/kg and adrenocorticotropic hormone at 2¬†mg/kg. The RNA-Seq analysis detected multiple differentially expressed genes. Four down-regulated genes were transcription factor genes (Nr4a1, Nr4a2, Nr4a3, and Ppard), which might be associated with the suppression of the adrenal cortex function. RNA-seq and qPCR showed that triphenyltin dose-dependently down-regulated the expression of the genes for cholesterol transport and biosynthesis, including Scarb1, Ldlr, Hmgcs1, Hmgcr, and Hsd17b7. Further Western blotting revealed that it lowered NR4A1, PPRAD, LDLR, and HMGCS1 protein levels. We treated H295R adrenal cells with 1-100¬†nM triphenyltin for 72¬†h. Triphenyltin induced significant higher ROS production at 100¬†nM and did not induce apoptosis at 10 and 100¬†nM.

36423848,-106,,,m6A contributes to a pro-survival state in GC-2 cells by facilitating DNA damage repair: Novel perspectives on the mechanism underlying DEHP genotoxicity in male germ cells.,"Di(2-ethyl-hexyl) phthalate (DEHP), an environmental endocrine disruptor, can destroy the sperm genomic integrity and impairs spermatogenesis. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is involved in the cellular effects of DEHP. However, the genotoxic effect of DEHP on spermatocytes and the possible role of m6A in this process remain unclear. This study demonstrated that m6A alleviates DEHP genotoxicity in GC-2 cells. In DEHP-treated mice, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) were induced in the testis and spermatocytes. To further explore the molecular mechanism of DEHP genotoxicity on spermatocytes, GC-2 cells were exposed to DEHP. DEHP produced distinct genotoxicity and caused DSBs, which led to the inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell cycle arrest. The DNA damage response (DDR) was initiated to repair the DSBs induced by environmentally relevant levels of DEHP (100 ŒºM and 200 ŒºM). During this process, METTL3 upregulated m6A, which facilitated the DDR via stabilizing the DNA damage repair factors (Rad51 and Xrcc5) mRNA to maintain the pro-survival state. Moreover, Mettl3 knockdown partially inhibited DDR. Interestingly, high-dose DEHP (400 ŒºM and 600 ŒºM) directly induced apoptosis rather than the pro-survival state. Altogether: METTL3-mediated m6A participates in maintaining the pro-survival state by upregulating DDR, providing guidance for mitigating the genotoxicity of environment-related level DEHP exposure.",,"CD166,Cancer,Cancer stem cells,Endometrium,OCT-4,Stem cells,Uterus,VSELs","Animals,Embryonic Stem Cells,Endometrial Neoplasms,Female,Humans,Hyperplasia,Mice,Pluripotent Stem Cells"

Thus, scientists worldwide are researching to develop non-ER binding starting compounds to fulfill unmet market needs. In line with this trending research topic, the current paper highlights the development of tetrazole derivatives bearing a bisphenol structure (TbB) as a novel weak binder or potential inactive to the estrogen receptor (ER) and androgen receptor (AR). The structure and ligand-based approach supported by binding affinity analysis, electrostatic complementarity, ADMET prediction, and in silico studies identified TbBs as privileged substitutes for BPA. Five TbB ligands were successfully synthesized and subjected to biological testing comprising radioligand competitive binding and functional cellular assays. The measured IC value for BPA was found to be 0.24 ŒºM, whereas all the inhibitions were less than 15% for the two TbB ligands, 223-2 and 223-3. As these TbB ligands did not meet the established acceptance criteria of 50% inhibition, they are considered as extremely weak binders to ERŒ±. Steric clashes, the desolvation effect, and the increased total polar surface area (TPSA) of TbB ligands in the hydrophobic binding site are hypothesized to be possible reasons for low binding. Modeling studies complemented by bioassays highlight TbB compounds as privileged prospective BPA replacements.

33098425,-106,,,Acetaminophen Modulates the Expression of Steroidogenesis-Associated Genes and Estradiol Levels in Human Placental JEG-3 Cells.,"Acetaminophen is the only medication recommended for pain and fever management during pregnancy. However, studies have reported an association between in utero acetaminophen and neurocognitive disorders later in life. Additionally, acetaminophen has been shown to have endocrine disrupting properties altering hormones critical for normal fetal development. As the placenta is an endocrine organ that produces hormones for fetal development, any attempts to elucidate the mechanism underlying in utero acetaminophen and birth outcomes must also focus on the placenta. The present study set out to examine the effect of acetaminophen on mRNA expression, protein expression, and hormone synthesis in placental JEG-3 cells. The analysis focused on genes involved in steroidogenesis and acetaminophen metabolism as well those with known roles as nuclear receptors and transporters. The results highlight that at high concentrations, acetaminophen reduced the gene expression of aromatase (CYP19A1) and type 1 3Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD3B1), and increased the expression of 17Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD17B1). Additionally, acetaminophen at high concentrations also reduced the protein expression of aromatase (CYP19A1). These effects were accompanied by a significant dose-dependent decrease in estradiol secretion. Estradiol plays an important role in the development of reproductive organs and the brain of the developing fetus. This study highlights the potential for acetaminophen to interfere with hormone regulation during pregnancy and underscores the need for additional studies aimed at understanding the endocrine disruption activity of acetaminophen during fetal development.","Aromatase Inhibitors,Acetaminophen,Estradiol,Aromatase","Endocrine disruption,Risk characterisation,Testing","Animals,Endocrine Disruptors,Endocrine System,Environmental Exposure,Environmental Pollutants,Humans"
35041916,-106,,,Genistein-based reactive oxygen species-responsive nanomaterial site-specifically relieves the intestinal toxicity of endocrine-disrupting chemicals.,"Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can disrupt the gastrointestinal endocrine system and induce oxidative stress, which eventually leads to intestinal toxicity. Genistein (Gen) has a beneficial effect on the physiological functions of the gastrointestinal tract and can alleviate EDCs damage. As an estrogen-like substance, Gen may also synergize the deleterious influence of EDCs. Therefore, the targeting and concentration of Gen must be controlled during its application. In this study, a novel reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive nanomaterial (Gen-NM-2) containing Tempol conjugated Œ≤-cyclodextrin and Gen was prepared. The nano-polymer exhibits a uniform rod-like morphology with an average diameter of 833¬†¬±¬†12¬†nm and a negative zeta-potential of -20.3¬†¬±¬†3.7¬†mV. Gen-NM-2 protected Gen from rapid metabolism in gastrointestinal tract and displayed a strong ROS scavenging ability. In response to high ROS levels, this material can effectively locate the target site and release Gen, which then exerted its effect by reducing the ROS content and regulating the ERŒ≤ signaling pathway. Owing to its high bioavailability, Gen-NM-2 at relatively low doses can reduce the intestinal cytotoxicity of EDCs, thus providing a basis for the development of EDCs detoxification therapy.","Endocrine Disruptors,Estrogen Receptor beta,Reactive Oxygen Species,Genistein","endocrine-disrupting chemicals,exposome,hormone receptor,pollutant,trans-generational effects","Animals,Endocrine Disruptors,Endocrine System,Environmental Pollutants,Female,Humans,Male,Noncommunicable Diseases,Reproduction"

GBH residues in the wild, in animal and human food may expose non-target organisms to health risks, yet the developmental and cumulative effects of GBHs on physiology and reproduction remain poorly understood. We present the first long-term study on the effects of subtoxic GBH exposure (160¬†mg/kg) on multiple key physiological biomarkers (cellular oxidative status and neurotransmitters), gut microbiome, reproductive hormones, and reproduction in an avian model. We experimentally exposed in Japanese quail females and males (Coturnix japonica) to GBHs and respective controls from the age of 10 days-52 weeks. GBH exposure decreased hepatic activity of an intracellular antioxidant enzyme (catalase), independent of sex, but did not influence other intracellular oxidative stress biomarkers or neurotransmitter enzyme (acetylcholinesterase). GBH exposure altered overall gut microbiome composition, especially at a younger age and in females, and suppressed potentially beneficial microbes at an early age. Many of the microbial groups increased in frequency from 12 to 28 weeks under GBH exposure. GBH exposure decreased male testosterone levels both at sexual maturity and at 52 weeks of exposure, but did not clearly influence reproduction in either sex (maturation, testis size or egg production). Future studies are needed to characterize the effects on reproductive physiology in more detail.

34855766,-106,,,Evaluation of acetamiprid and azoxystrobin residues and their hormonal disrupting effects on male rats using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.,"Endocrine-disrupting compounds as pesticides affect the hormonal balance, and this can result in several diseases. Therefore, the analysis of representative hormones with acetamiprid (AC) and azoxystrobin (AZ) was a good strategy for the investigation of the endocrine-disrupting activity of pesticides. Hence, a sensitive and rapid analytical method using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was developed. The method was validated for the analysis of AC, AZ, estriol, estrone, progesterone, and testosterone in the serum, testis, and liver of rats. The correlation between the residues of pesticides and the disturbance of the endocrine system was evaluated. The different mass parameters, mobile phase types, analytical columns, injection volumes, and extraction solvents were compared to get the lowest limit of detection of the studied compounds. The detection limits of AC, AZ, estriol, estrone, progesterone, and testosterone were 0.05, 0.05, 1.0, 10, and 1.0 ng/ml, respectively. The method developed was applied to evaluate the changes in these hormones induced by the duration of exposure to AC and AZ in rat testis and serum. The hormones level in rat serum and testis had a significant decrease as they were oral gavage treated with different high concentrations of studied pesticides. Both pesticides were distributed in the body of rats by the multi-compartment model (liver, testis, and serum).","Endocrine Disruptors,Gonadal Steroid Hormones,Neonicotinoids,Pesticides,Pyrimidines,Strobilurins,Estrone,Testosterone,acetamiprid,Estriol,azoxystrobin","Mechanism,Reproduction,Species specificity,Triphenyltin","Animals,Endocrine Disruptors,Endocrine System,Female,Male,Mammals,Organotin Compounds,Trialkyltin Compounds"

Among them is estrogen signaling, important for the proliferation and differentiation of epithelial cells, immune signaling and metabolism. The mycotoxin zearalenone (ZEN) is an estrogen disruptor naturally found in food and feed. The exposure of the intestine to ZEN has toxic effects including alteration of the immune status and is possibly implicated in carcinogenesis, but the molecular mechanisms linked with these effects are not clear. Our objective was to explore the proteome changes induced by a short, non-cytotoxic exposure to ZEN in the intestine using pig jejunal explants. Our results indicated that ZEN promotes little proteome changes, but significantly related with an induction of ERŒ± signaling and a consequent disruption of highly interrelated signaling cascades, such as NF-Œ∫B, ERK1/2, CDX2 and HIF1Œ±. The toxicity of ZEN leads also to an altered immune status characterized by the activation of the chemokine CXCR4/SDF-1 axis and an accumulation of MHC-I proteins. Our results connect the estrogen disrupting activity of ZEN with its intestinal toxic effect, associating the exposure to ZEN with cell-signaling disorders similar to those involved in the onset and progression of diseases such as cancer and chronic inflammatory disorders. SIGNIFICANCE: The proteomics results presented in our study indicate that the endocrine disruptor activity of ZEN is able to regulate a cascade of highly inter-connected signaling events essential for the small intestinal crypt-villus cycle and immune status. These molecular mechanisms are also implicated in the onset and progress of intestinal immune disorders and cancer indicating that exposure to ZEN could play an important role in intestinal pathogenesis.","Estrogens,Mycotoxins,Proteome,Zearalenone","Dimethyl terephthalate,Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay,Estrogenic endocrine-disrupting chemicals,Meat products,Vitellogenin","Animals,Endocrine Disruptors,Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay,Estrogens,Estrone,Female,Male,Meat Products,Vitellogenins"

36084822,-105,,,The anti-androgenic fungicide triticonazole induces region-specific transcriptional changes in the developing rat perineum and phallus.,"Intrauterine exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals can interfere with male reproductive development. This can lead to male reproductive disorders such as hypospadias, cryptorchidism and reduced fertility, as well as shorter anogenital distance (AGD) - a biomarker for incomplete androgen-dependent fetal masculinization. However, it remains challenging to predict adverse in vivo outcomes based on in vitro effect patterns for many chemicals. This is a challenge for modern toxicology, which aims to reduce animal testing for chemical safety assessments. To enable the transition towards higher reliance on alternative test methods, we need to better map underlying mechanisms leading to adverse effects. Herein, we have analyzed the transcriptome of the perineum and phallus of male fetal rats and defined the impacts of exposure to an anti-androgenic fungicide, triticonazole. Previously we have shown that developmental exposure to triticonazole can induce short male AGD, but without a marked effect on the transcriptome of the fetal testes. In contrast, we report here significant changes to the transcriptional landscape of the perineum and phallus, including regional differences between these adjacent tissues. This highlights the importance of analyzing the correct tissue when characterizing mechanisms of complex in vivo effect outcomes. Our results provide a rich resource for the spatiotemporal gene networks that are involved in the development of male external genitalia, and that can be disrupted upon exposure to chemicals that prevent normal masculinization of the perineum and phallus. Such data will be critical in the development of novel alternative test methods to determine the endocrine disrupting potential of existing and emerging chemicals.","Androgen Antagonists,Biomarkers,Cyclopentanes,Endocrine Disruptors,Fungicides, Industrial,Triazoles,triticonazole","Apoptosis,BPA,EDCs,Fibrosis,Metabolism,Phthalates,Steatohepatitis","Animals,Endocrine Disruptors,Fatty Liver,Male,Mice"

Although direct and ancestral exposures can each lead to deficits in behaviors, their interactions are not known. Here we focused on social behaviors based on evidence of their vulnerability to direct or ancestral exposures, together with their importance in reproduction and survival of a species. Using a novel ""two hits, three generations apart"" experimental rat model, we investigated interactions of two classes of EDCs across six generations. PCBs (a weakly estrogenic mixture Aroclor 1221, 1 mg/kg), Vinclozolin (antiandrogenic, 1 mg/kg) or vehicle (6% DMSO in sesame oil) were administered to pregnant rat dams (F0) to directly expose the F1 generation, with subsequent breeding through paternal or maternal lines. A second EDC hit was given to F3 dams, thereby exposing the F4 generation, with breeding through the F6 generation. Approximately 1200 male and female rats from F1, F3, F4 and F6 generations were run through tests of sociability and social novelty as indices of social preference. We leveraged machine learning using DeepLabCut to analyze nuanced social behaviors such as nose touching with accuracy similar to a human scorer. Surprisingly, social behaviors were affected in ancestrally exposed but not directly exposed individuals, particularly females from a paternally exposed breeding lineage. Effects varied by EDC: Vinclozolin affected aspects of behavior in the F3 generation while PCBs affected both the F3 and F6 generations. Taken together, our data suggest that specific aspects of behavior are particularly vulnerable to heritable ancestral exposure of EDC contamination, that there are sex differences, and that lineage is a key factor in transgenerational outcomes.",,"endocrine-disrupting chemicals,miRNA,ovary,phthalates,steroidogenesis","Animals,Endocrine Disruptors,Female,Humans,Mice,MicroRNAs,Phthalic Acids,Pregnancy,Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects,Rats,Reproduction"

Bisphenol A (BPA) can regulate the estrogenic signals to modulate cancer progression, while its roles in NC were not investigated. Our present study revealed that the BPA can increase proliferation and migration of NPC cells while decrease the chemosensitivity to doxorubicin (Dox). The inhibitor of GSK-3Œ≤/Œ≤-catenin (LiCl) can restore BPA-induced cell proliferation of NPC cells, which is due to that BPA can decrease phosphorylation while increase expression and nucleus localization of Œ≤-catenin. Mechanistically, BPA can increase the mRNA stability of Œ≤-catenin (encoded by CTNNB1) via suppressing the expression of miR-214-3p, which can direct target the 3'UTR of Œ≤-catenin mRNA. Further, BPA can decrease phosphorylation of Œ≤-catenin via repressing the expression of CK1Œ±.

However, the literature classifies parabens as endocrine-disrupting chemicals, and an assessment of their influence on the endocrine system and systemic toxicity is important. This study explored long-term systemic toxicity, effects on the endocrine system, and toxicokinetic behavior after repeated subcutaneous administration of butylparaben to Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats were treated with vehicle (4% Tween 80) or butylparaben at dose levels of 2, 10, and 50¬†mg/kg/day for 13¬†weeks. Assessment of systemic toxicity and endocrine-disrupting effects was based on mortality; clinical signs; body weight; food and water consumption; ophthalmological findings; urinalysis; hematology and clinical biochemistry; organ weights; necropsy and histopathological findings; regularity and length of the estrous cycle; semen quality; and toxicokinetic behavior. Female uterine weight and estrous cycle, and male semen quality indicated no estrogenic effects. Butylparaben induced local irritation at the injection site in both sexes at a dose of 50¬†mg/kg/day, but systemic toxicity was not observed. Therefore, the no-observed-adverse-effect level of butylparaben is set at 50¬†mg/kg/day in rats of both sexes. Butylparaben was without endocrine system effects at this dose.

This study evaluated the toxic actions of ATR-MET by in vivo and in silico methods. Here, varying doses of ATR-MET were orally administered to rats once daily for twenty-one days using normal saline as control. Molecular docking was used to characterize the binding of ATR and MET with androgen receptor (AR) to predict their potential endocrine-disrupting effects, using testosterone as benchmark. ATR-MET-induced-testicular toxicity (reduced sperm motility, count, and daily sperm production and increased live/dead ratio) was accompanied with testicular oxidative stress (diminished level of reduced glutathione, activities of glutathione-S-transferase, superoxide dismutase and catalase and increased level of malondialdehyde). Furthermore, ATR-MET induced cardiovascular toxicity (increased levels of plasma total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides) with concomitant induction of renal toxicity (increased plasma creatinine and urea levels), and hepatotoxicity (increased plasma bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, acid phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase). Binding energy and amino acid interactions from in silico study revealed that MET possessed endocrine-disrupting capacity.

These effects are a consequence of BPA's estrogenic activity and its ability to act as an endocrine disrupter even, at very low doses. When exposure to BPA occurs during critical periods of development, it can interfere with the normal activity of sex steroids, impacting the fate of neurons, neural connectivity and the development of brain regions sensitive to steroid activity. Among the most sensitive behavioral targets of BPA action are behaviors that are characterized by a sexual dimorphism, especially emotion and anxiety related behaviors, such as the amount of time spent investigating a novel environment, locomotive activity and arousal. Moreover, in some species of rodents, BPA exposure affected males' sexual behaviors. Interestingly, these behaviors are at least in part modulated by the catecholaminergic system, which has been reported to be a target of BPA action. In the present study we investigated the influence of prenatal exposure of mice to a very low single dose of BPA on emotional and sexual behaviors and on the density and binding characteristics of alpha adrenergic receptors. Alpha adrenergic receptors are widespread in the central nervous system and they can act as autoreceptors, inhibiting the release of noradrenaline and other neurotransmitters from presynaptic terminals. BPA exposure disrupted sex differences in behavioral responses to a novel environment, but did not affect male mice sexual behavior.

Four triazole fungicides regulated eight major genes involved in estrogen synthesis (StAR, CYP11A1, 3Œ≤HSD2, CYP17, CYP19, CYP3A4, CYP1A2 and SCP2) and stimulated the secretion of 17Œ≤-estradiol (E). Finally, we assessed possible metabolic outcomes caused by abnormal estrogen synthesis, and found that triazole fungicides affected the metabolism of various macromolecules (such as lipid, amino acid, and carbohydrate) and signal transduction. These findings will provide new insights into endocrine-disrupting effects of triazole fungicides and highlight their potential ecological and health risks.'}","Estrogen Receptor alpha,Estrogens,Fungicides, Industrial,Triazoles,Estradiol","Biomonitoring,C-BED,Chronic contamination,Emergent contaminant,M. galloprovincialis,Multibiomarkers","Animals,Environmental Monitoring,Water Pollutants, Chemical,Transcriptome,Mytilus,Biomarkers"
35228410,-104,,,Effect of Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate on the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis in adolescent rat.,"Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is extensively used in many personal care and consumer products, which results in widespread human exposure. Limited studies have suggested that exposure to DEHP may affect thyroid function, but little is known about the effect and mechanisms of DEHP exposure on the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis (HPTA). The present study was conducted to elucidate the potential mechanisms underlying DEHP disrupting the function of the HPTA. DEHP was administered to Wistar rats by gavage at 0, 5, 50, and 500 mg/kg/day for consecutive 28 days and then the rats were sacrificed within 24 h following the last dose. The hormone levels of HPTA were quantified with radioimmunoassay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the protein levels of thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor (TRHR) and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) were analyzed by Western blot and immunohistochemistry, and the expression levels of TRHR and TSHR mRNA were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. The low dose of DEHP increased the body weights of rats. Serum levels of T3, T4, FT3 and FT4 as well as protein and mRNA levels of TSHR decreased in rats treated with 50 mg/kg or 500 mg/kg DEHP compared with those of controls. Although the protein levels of TRH in the hypothalamus or protein and mRNA levels of TRHR in pituitary were up-regulated, serum levels of TSH did not change statistically in rats treated with DEHP. Therefore, DEHP can produce thyroid toxicity and may interfere with the secretion of pituitary TSH. In conclusion, DEHP could interfere with the balance of HPTA of adolescent rats, and disturb the homeostasis of thyroid related hormones and the expression levels of receptors.",,"Developmental toxicity,Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC),Hepatotoxicity,Neurotoxicity,Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA)","Animals,Environmental Pollutants,Flame Retardants,Humans,Polybrominated Biphenyls,Water Pollutants, Chemical"
35593412,-104,,,Low concentrations of bisphenol A promote the activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway on Beta-TC-6 cells via the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial superoxide.,"Œ§he natural history of type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by a progressive loss of pancreatic beta cell function and insulin resistance. Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine-disrupting chemical that is used widely in industry; people are exposed to BPA and its products daily. Studies have delineated that BPA alters the function of pancreatic beta cells. Herein, we examined the effect of low doses of BPA on pancreatic beta cell viability and apoptosis and we tried to elucidate the mechanisms involved in these processes. Beta-TC-6 (ATCC¬Æ CRL-11506‚Ñ¢) cells were cultured with a medium containing the following dilutions of BPA: 0.002, 0.02, 0.1, 0.2, 2‚ÄâŒºŒú up to 72‚Äâh. We examined the viability and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels of cells. Then, we measured apoptosis, cell cycle, and insulin levels. We quantified the levels of proteins implicated in the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis; and finally, we quantified the intracellular reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial superoxide. We found that the exposure of Beta-TC-6 cells to BPA results in a decrease in cell viability, ATP levels, and an increase in insulin levels. We found an increase in apoptosis levels and a decrease in cell cycle levels. In addition, we provide evidence of the levels of apoptotic proteins. Finally, we found an increase in the cellular reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial superoxide production. Exposure to low concentrations of BPA triggers the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis via the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial superoxide on Beta-TC-6 cells in a dose-dependent way.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Insulins,Phenols,Reactive Oxygen Species,Superoxides,Adenosine Triphosphate,bisphenol A","Detoxication,Endocrine disrupting chemicals,Hormone biosynthesis,Organometallic compounds,Steroid isomerization,Structural biology","Animals,Environmental Pollutants,Glutathione,Glutathione Transferase,Horses,Organotin Compounds,Steroids"
34273429,-104,,,In vitro and in silico investigations of endocrine disruption induced by metabolites of plasticizers through glucocorticoid receptor.,"The endocrine disruptive capability of plasticizers to activate nuclear receptors has attracted great interest. This study is aimed to assess the potential glucocorticoid effects of metabolites of plasticizers. The effects of metabolites of plasticizers on the transcriptional activity of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) were investigated using reporter gene assays. All of them failed to exhibit agonistic/antagonistic effects on GR. However, a combination of dexamethasone and monobutyl phthalate (MBP) could synergistically activate GR. MBP combined with dexamethasone also enhanced GR nuclear translocation by Western blot, while mifepristone restrained GR cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation. MBP co-treated with dexamethasone resulted in synergistic induction of PEPCK and MKP-1 gene expression by real-time PCR and PEPCK protein level by Western blot. Furthermore, the carboxyl and ester groups of MBP have influences on the charge distribution of MBP, leading to change of electrostatic interactions between MBP and GR by calculations on electronic properties. Both hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions play a crucial role in the stabilization between MBP and GR conducted by molecular docking and dynamics simulation. This work confirms that GR could remain stable upon binding to MBP. In conclusion, dexamethasone and MBP could synergistically activate GR, resulting in synergetic enhancement of subsequent GR-mediated endocrine disrupting effect.","Endocrine Disruptors,Phthalic Acids,Plasticizers,Receptors, Glucocorticoid,Dexamethasone,monobutyl phthalate",,"Animals,Enzymes,Mollusca,Steroids"

Here we investigated the in¬†vitro metabolism of dioxybenzone, detected the residue of metabolites in rats, and determined the estrogenic disrupting effects of these metabolites toward estrogen receptor Œ± (ERŒ±). In¬†vitro metabolism revealed two major metabolites from dioxybenzone, i.e., M1 through the demethylation of methoxy moiety and M2 through hydroxylation of aromatic carbon. M1 and M2 were both rapidly detected in rat plasma upon exposure to dioxybenzone, which were then distributed into organs of rats in the order of livers¬†>¬†kidneys¬†>¬†uteri¬†>¬†ovaries. The 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation revealed that M1 and M2 formed hydrogen bond to residue Leu387 and Glu353, respectively, on ERŒ± ligand binding domain, leading to a reduced binding free energy. M1 and M2 also significantly induced estrogenic effect in comparison to dioxybenzone as validated by the recombinant ERŒ± yeast two-hybrid assay and uterotrophic assay. Overall, our study revealed the potential of metabolic activation of dioxybenzone to induce estrogenic disrupting effects, suggesting the need for incorporating metabolic evaluation into the health risk assessment of benzophenones and their structurally similar analogs.","Benzophenones,Estrogen Receptor alpha,Estrogens,dioxybenzone","HPA axis,Neurotrophins,Prevention of mental illness,Psychiatric disorders,Stress","Animals,Epigenesis, Genetic,Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System,Mental Disorders,Nerve Growth Factors,Pituitary-Adrenal System,Stress, Psychological"

However, whether benzophenone-3 exposure can influence the sex steroid hormones levels remains unknown. We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which is a cross-sectional dataset, from 2013 to 2016. A total of 1690 male US participants aged 18 or above were included. Urinary benzophenone-3, serum total testosterone, serum estradiol, serum sex hormone-binding globulin were measured. Confounders including age, body mass index, race, education level, urinary creatinine, ratio of family income to poverty, alcohol use, time of venipuncture, cardiac arterial diabetic score, energy intake, bisphenol A, triclosan and total parabens were controlled. After full adjustment (Model III), the upper benzophenone-3 quintiles had odds ratios (95 % confidence intervals) of testosterone deficiency of 1.75 (1.03, 2.99), 2.47 (1.53, 3.98), 2.08 (1.13, 3.84) and 1.74 (0.94, 3.23) compared with quintile 1. Compared with quintile 1, percent changes (95 % confidence intervals) in testosterone were -¬†12 % (-19 %, -5 %) and -¬†9 % (-17 %, -1 %) for quintile 3 and quintile 5 in Model III. Estradiol and sex hormone-binding globulin were generally similar to total testosterone in the associations with benzophenone-3. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that adult men in the US with higher urinary benzophenone-3 had a higher risk of testosterone deficiency and had inverse associations with total testosterone, estradiol and sex hormone-binding globulin. To confirm the causal links between benzophenone-3 and sex steroid hormones, prospective studies are needed.","Estradiol,Gonadal Steroid Hormones,oxybenzone,Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin,Testosterone,Endocrine Disruptors,Benzophenones","clover disease,endocrine disruptor,phytoestrogen,reproduction,ruminant","Animals,Estradiol,Estrogens,Phytoestrogens,Receptors, Estrogen,Reproduction,Sheep"

More than 90% of all PCPs contain the UV-B filter octylmethoxycinnamate (OMC) as a protective function, however, their safety has recently been questioned. The purpose of the present work was to understand how the long-term exposure of UV-filter OMC, used daily by pregnant women, disrupts their vascular homeostasis, altering vascular responses of proteins and channels involved in contractile processes. The long-term effects of 24\xa0h of exposure to OMC (1, 10, and 50\xa0Œºmol/L) were evaluated on contractile responses of human umbilical arteries (HUA) to serotonin and potassium chloride. Since OMC altered vascular homeostasis of arteries, its vascular mode of action was explored in more detail through the analysis of the activity of cGMP and Ca-channels, two pathways involved in their relaxation and contraction, respectively. Our findings showed that long-term exposure of UV-filter OMC impaired the main vasorelaxant mechanism of HUA, once OMC altered the vasorelaxant response pattern of sodium nitroprusside and nifedipine. Results also showed that long-term exposure to OMC induced a decreased vasorelaxation response on HUA due to an interference with the NO/sGC/cGMP/PKG pathway. Moreover, OMC seems to modulate the L-type Ca channels, the BKCa 1.1 Œ±-subunit channels, and the PKG. Overall, since OMC compromises the vascular homeostasis of pregnant women it can be an inductor of pregnancy hypertensive disorders.'}","Cinnamates,Vasodilator Agents,Nitric Oxide,octylmethoxycinnamate",,"Animals,Estradiol,Female,Follicle Stimulating Hormone,Follicular Phase,Hydrocortisone,Luteinizing Hormone,Progesterone,Sheep"
34740714,-104,,,Changes in gut-brain axis parameters in adult rats of both sexes with different feeding pattern that were early nicotine-exposed.,"Nicotine is an endocrine disruptor and imprinting factor during breastfeeding that can cause food intake imbalance in the adulthood. As nicotine affects the intestinal microbiota, altering the composition of the bacterial communities and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) synthesis in a sex-dependent manner, we hypothesized that nicotine could program the gut-brain axis, consequently modifying the eating pattern of adult male and female rats in a model of maternal nicotine exposure (MNE) during breastfeeding. Lactating Wistar rat dams received minipumps that release 6¬†mg/kg/day of nicotine (MNE group) or saline for 14 days. The progeny received standard diet from weaning until euthanasia (26 weeks of age). We measured: in vivo electrical activity of the vagus nerve; c-Fos expression in the nucleus tractus solitarius, gastrointestinal peptides receptors, intestinal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), SCFAs and microbiota. MNE females showed hyperphagia despite normal adiposity, while MNE males had unchanged food intake, despite obesity. Adult MNE offspring showed decreased Bacteroidetes and increased Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. MNE females had lower fecal acetate while MNE males showed higher vagus nerve activity. In summary nicotine exposure through the milk induces long-term intestinal dysbiosis, which may affect eating patterns of adult offspring in a sex-dependent manner.",Nicotine,,"Animals,Estradiol,Female,Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone,Hydrocortisone,Hypothalamus,Luteinizing Hormone,Ovariectomy,Periodicity,Pituitary Gland,Sheep"

Given this knowledge gap, the present work was aimed at determining the potential impact of chronic exposure to polystyrene nanoplastics (PS NPs) on the thyroid endocrine status and biochemical stress in a rat model. Young adult male rats were orally administered with PS NPs (1, 3, 6 and 10 mg kg day) for five weeks. Thyroid hormones (THs) l-thyroxine (T4), l-triiodothyronine (T3), l-free triiodothyronine (FT3), and l-free thyroxine (FT4) as well as thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) serum levels of normal rats and those exposed to PS NPs were compared. Serum levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), cholesterol, and creatinine, as well as glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) and glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) enzymes were also measured. Exposure to PS NPs suppressed the serum levels of T3 and circulating levels of THs, whereas TSH increased significantly. Though exposure to PS NPs did not affect the molar ratios of T3/T4, it induced a slight, but significant, increase in FT3/FT4. In addition, exposure to plastic nanoparticles showed signs of nephrotoxicity induction and kidney injury in exposed organisms as can be inferred from the significantly higher serum levels of creatinine in exposed groups.

34478800,-104,,,Appraisal of the human health related toxicological information available on dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) in view of assessing the substance's potential to cause endocrine disruption.,"Dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) is an olefinic hydrocarbon which is manufactured and imported into the European Union (EU) at greater than 1000 tons per year. Concerns related to fetotoxic effects observed in reproductive toxicity studies at high doses led the REACH registrants to self-classify DCPD as a Category 2 reproductive toxicant under the EU CLP Regulation. DCPD was also reviewed in the European Union in the frame of an ongoing European Chemical Agency (ECHA) Community Rolling Action Plan (CoRAP) procedure and under the French National Strategy on Endocrine Disruptors (SNPE). To elucidate whether the developmental effects may be triggered by an endocrine mode of action, the Lower Olefins Sector Group (LOSG) of the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC) formed an ad hoc expert team to review the available scientific information pertaining to the potential endocrine activity and adversity of DCPD. Existing experimental data was complemented with structure activity modelling using ECHA-recommended (Q)SAR tools. Overall, considering the available information from (Q)SAR, mechanistic in vitro and in vivo studies, no indication of endocrine-mediated adversity was found. Hence, the available evidence supports the conclusion that DCPD does not cause developmental toxicity via an endocrine mode of action. Further work is ongoing to support this conclusion.","Endocrine Disruptors,Indenes,Receptors, Estrogen,Receptors, Retinoic Acid,dicyclopentadiene","estrogen,estrogen receptor,hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis,hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis,stress","Animals,Estrogens,Female,Homeostasis,Hypothalamus,Male,Neurosecretory Systems,Sex Characteristics"

Given that phenols are considered endocrine disrupting chemicals with the potential to interfere with hormonal activities, they could have adverse effects on female reproductive health. We analyzed cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2003-2006 to examine the association between phenols and endometriosis and uterine leiomyoma (fibroids). Levels of bisphenol A (BPA), benzophenone-3, and triclosan were measured using urine samples, and information on endometriosis and fibroids diagnoses as well as other relevant characteristics were ascertained using self-reported questionnaires. Multivariate logistic regression with odds ratios (ORs) and 95¬†% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to quantify the association between each phenol and female gynecologic condition. Our study included 700 women, of which 53 women had endometriosis and 107 women had fibroids. We found exposure to BPA to be statistically significantly positively associated with endometriosis (p¬†=¬†0.05); women in the highest exposure quartile had over the three times the odds of having endometriosis relative to women in the lowest quartile (OR=3.58, 95¬†% CI 1.00-12.89). None of the phenols considered were significantly associated with fibroids. Overall, exposure to BPA increased the odds of having endometriosis, and there appeared to be a dose-response relationship. This suggests that BPA may play a role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis although the cross-sectional nature of NHANES data is a methodological limitation. Additional research on the impact of endocrine disrupting chemicals, like phenols, on female reproductive health should be conducted.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Pollutants,Phenols,Phenol,Triclosan,bisphenol A",,"Animals,Extracellular Matrix,Fibrosis,Humans,Integrins,Mice,Mice, Transgenic,Signal Transduction,Transforming Growth Factor beta,Wound Healing"
34273420,-103,,,Chronic exposure to low doses of bisphenol A alters hydromineral responses in rats.,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is a chemical commonly used in the industrial sectors, hence humans are exposed to the compound repetitively. BPA is an endocrine disruptor and has been anticipated to interfere on chemical estrogen receptor functions and other nuclear hormone receptors. Estrogens are steroid hormones that, in addition to their neuroendocrine roles, affect water and salt intakes in numerous species, including humans and rodents. Changes in the hydrosaline balance produce compensatory behavioral and physiological responses, which serve to preserve or restore osmolarity and blood volume to optimal levels, thus preventing cardiovascular disease. The aim of the present work was to determine for first time the effect of long-term and low-dose BPA treatment on thirst and sodium appetite. Wistar rats were exposed to BPA via drinking water to mimic the most likely route of human exposure, and different dipsogenic and natriorexigenic stimuli were assessed. The BPA-treated rats tend to drink less water that control rats following 24-h fluid restriction, but there was no statistically significant decrease. Perhaps the BPA dose does not have enough estrogenic potency to affect water intake. In the extracellular fluid depletion test, the control rats significantly increased 2.7% NaCl solution intake on repeated testing, showing sodium appetite sensitization, i.e. the capacity to enhance sodium intake produced by stimulus repetition; whereas BPA-treated rats did not. In this study, fluid and electrolyte balance in BPA-treated rats is generally adequate but impaired in osmotic challenges, for example by sodium depletion. Thus, neuroendocrine systems involved in maintaining body fluid and electrolyte homeostasis were altered in BPA-treated rats.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Phenols,bisphenol A","Decellularization,Endocrine pancreas,Extracellular matrix,Pancreatic islet,Type 1 diabetes","Animals,Extracellular Matrix,Humans,Insulin-Secreting Cells,Islets of Langerhans,Tissue Engineering"

CdCl suppressed cell growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner (IC50 value ~10 ŒºM) associated with a decrease in levels of phospho-ERK. In addition, CdCl elicited an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and lipid peroxidation. A significant increase in GRP78, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related protein, was also observed. Supplementation of quercetin counteracted the growth-inhibiting action of CdCl by recovering ERK protein phosphorylation levels, attenuating ROS overproduction, decreasing MDA content and reducing the expression of GRP78 in cells exposed to CdCl.

35644309,-103,,,Sex-specific influence of maternal exposure to bisphenol A on sodium and fluid balance in response to dipsogenic challenges in rats.,"The plasticizer bisphenol A (BPA) is one of the highest volume chemicals produced worldwide. Human exposure to BPA occurs almost constantly. BPA is an endocrine disruptor that interferes in estrogen receptor functions. This is important for the developing brain, which is particularly sensitive to the estrogenic effects of BPA. Body fluid balance is maintained by a complex network of systems that regulate sodium and water intakes and electrolyte excretion. The development of these control systems occurs during early life and therefore, may be susceptible to changes in the uterine environment. The aim of this work was to study the effects of two low BPA doses in the dam, during pregnancy and lactation, on adult offspring drinking and sodium and urine excretion after dipsogenic challenge. Dams were exposed to BPA in drinking water to mimic the most likely route of human exposure. The results showed that BPA did not disrupt spontaneous fluid balance, but altered sodium and fluid intakes in the BPA offspring under osmotic challenges. In experiments, both 24h fluid deprivation and sodium depletion modified fluid ingestive response in BPA offspring compared to control offspring. The increased preference for 2.7% NaCl solution in male BPA offspring is similar to female control offspring, altered ingestive behavior appears to be due to feminization of males and ""hyperfeminization"" of female BPA offspring, as they drink more than female control offspring. Our results indicate that exposure to low doses of BPA in early life may disrupt the development of sex-specific drinking behaviors by altering the steroid programming of the brain, and this disruption affects males and females differently.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Phenols,Sodium,bisphenol A","Cytochrome P450,Di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate,Jejunum,Nrf2 signaling pathway,Nuclear xenobiotic receptors","Animals,Female,Coturnix,NF-E2-Related Factor 2,Quail,Diethylhexyl Phthalate,Xenobiotics,Jejunum,Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear,Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"

Previous researches demonstrated that DBP exposure impaired spermatogenesis, however, the molecular mechanism is largely uncovered. In this study, we demonstrated that prenatal exposure to DBP increased receptor activator of nuclear factor-Œ∫B ligand (RANKL) expression in seminiferous tubules, especially in Sertoli cells. Western blot and immunofluorescence assays showed that DBP induced up-regulation of RANKL expression in Sertoli cells. Furthermore, experimental data showed that DBP increased COX-2 and p-p65 expression in Sertoli cells and depleting COX-2 and p-p65 by specific inhibitor NS3-98 and BAY117082 could partially abolish DBP induced up-regulation of RANKL. Moreover, the content of RANKL in Sertoli cells was significantly increased after DBP exposure by conducting enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which promoted spermatogonial stem cells (C18-4 cells) apoptosis in a paracrine manner. Together, our data demonstrated that a novel mechanism for DBP induced impairment of spermatogenesis by activating NF-Œ∫B/COX-2/RANKL signaling in Sertoli cells, and provided a diagnostic and therapeutic target.","NF-kappa B,RANK Ligand,Dibutyl Phthalate,Cyclooxygenase 2",,"Animals,Female,Femur,Growth Plate,Lactation,Male,Maternal Exposure,Polychlorinated Biphenyls,Pregnancy,Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects,Rats,Rats, Wistar"
32403013,-103,,,Adipogenic effects of prenatal exposure to bisphenol S (BPS) in adult F1 male mice.,"Bisphenol S (BPS) has been increasingly used as a substitute for bisphenol A (BPA), a known endocrine disruptor. Early-life exposure to BPA affects fetal development and the risk of obesity in adolescence and adulthood. However, the effects of fetal exposure BPS in later life are unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effects of prenatal BPS exposure on adiposity in adult F1 mice. Pregnant C57BL/6¬†N mice were exposed to BPS (0, 0.05, 0.5, 5, and 50¬†mg/kg/d) via drinking water from gestation day 9 until delivery. Thereafter, two groups of offspring (6¬†weeks old) were either administered a standard diet (STD) or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 4¬†weeks until euthanasia. The body weight and gonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT) mass were determined, and the energy expenditure for the adiposity phenotype was computed especially for male mice, followed by histological analysis of the gWAT. Thereafter, the expression levels of adipogenic marker genes (Pparg, Cebpa, Fabp4, Lpl, and Adipoq) were analyzed in the gWAT via reverse-transcription PCR analysis. BPS-exposed male mice displayed apparent gWAT hypertrophy, consistent with the significant increase in adipocyte size in the gWAT and upregulation of Pparg and its direct target genes among HFD mice in comparison with the control mice. These results suggest that prenatal BPS exposure potentially increases the susceptibility to HFD-induced adipogenesis in male adult mice.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Phenols,Sulfones,bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)sulfone","NR5A1,hyperandrogenism,infertility,metabolism,ovary","Animals,Female,Fertility,Homeostasis,Infertility,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Obesity,Ovary,Phenotype,Steroidogenic Factor 1"

Two hundred SPF Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups (n = 40 per group): blank control group (corn oil), low-dose NP exposure group (0.4 mg/kg/d), medium-dose NP exposure group (4 mg/kg/d), high-dose NP exposure group (40 mg/kg/d), and estradiol control group (E: 30 Œºg/kg/d). The rats were treated by gavage for 34 weeks, which were sampled twice (17 weeks and 34 weeks respectively). NP accumulation in the thyroid tissue (F = 52.93, P < 0.001) and serum (F = 5.54, P = 0.00) continuously increased in a significant dose-effect relationship. After NP exposure, the serum FT3 levels exhibited a dose-dependent increasing trend (F = 4.68, P = 0.01), while the serum FT4 level showed an opposite trend (F = 3.93, P= 0.01). Compared with the control group, hyperechoic areas (i.e., calcification points) were observed in the high-dose group. Follicular epithelial stratification was extremely severe, the monolayer cubic epithelial cells became flat, and the area of single follicles was even smaller in the high-dose group. In the high-dose NP group, there were numerous mitochondria that were severely swollen. The rough endoplasmic reticulum was abundant, with obvious expansion and vesiculation.

35577041,-103,,,"Effect of BPA on CYP450s expression, and nicotine modulation, in fetal rat brain.","Human exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) is mainly due to migration from plastic packaging into food and beverages. Studies reported BPA endocrine disruptions through interactions with different nuclear receptors, including the arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR). AhR mediates xenobiotic responses and regulates expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs), including many CYP450s. This study aimed to assess the effects of BPA maternal exposure on CYP450s expression in fetal brain. Sprague-Dawley dams were exposed to BPA concentrations of 0, 0.5, 5, and 50¬†mg/L in drinking water, individually, and with nicotine. Fetal brains were isolated at gestational days GD14 and GD19, and protein expression was assessed by Western blotting. Results showed a BPA-induced significant decrease in CYP1B1 expression levels at GD14 (p¬†=¬†0.001), and CYP19A1 (aromatase) expression at both mid- and late-stage development (p¬†<¬†0.001). In addition, nicotine individually decreased expression levels of all examined protein targets, significantly for CYP1B1 (p¬†<¬†0.001), CYP19A1 (p¬†=¬†0.010), AhRR (p¬†=¬†0.042), and ARNT (p¬†<¬†0.001), compared to control. When combined with BPA, nicotine suppressive effects were attenuated at both GD14 and GD19. In conclusion, BPA suppresses CYP1B1 and CYP19A1 expression in fetal brain, and attenuates the suppressive effects of nicotine. Observed effects may be mediated by AhR-ARNT independent mechanisms that need further examination.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Phenols,Nicotine,bisphenol A","Developmental toxicity,Endocrine disrupting chemicals,Pregnancy","Animals,Female,Fetal Development,Hormones,Placenta,Placentation,Pregnancy,Trophoblasts"

34215981,-103,,,Association of maternal exposure to bisphenol A with her Œ≤-hCG level and neonatal anthropometric measures.,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is one of the organic compounds that might interfere with estrogenic receptors, which would make difficulties in pregnancy hormones and fetal growth. Human chorionic gonadotropin (Œ≤-hCG) is one of the important pregnancy hormones that might be affected by environmental pollutants. The aim of this study is to investigate the probable impacts of maternal exposure to BPA on anthropometric measures of newborns. This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2019-2020 in Isfahan, Iran. During the first trimester of pregnancy, we measured the urinary BPA concentration and serum Œ≤-hCG level of 120 pregnant women, who were randomly selected from participants of a birth cohort. BPA concentration was measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Serum blood sample was derived and used for Œ≤-hCG analysis. Anthropometric measurement of neonates was conducted at the time of birth. BPA and Œ≤-hCG level were grouped by quartiles, and their associations with birth weight, height, and head circumference were tested using multiple linear regression model. The adjustment was done for urine creatinine, gender, and gestational age, as well as maternal age, body mass index, and education level. Data of 119 pairs of mothers and infants were available for the present study. The mean (SD) age of mothers was 29.19 (5.75) years; 56.3% of newborns were boys. Geometric mean of urinary BPA and Œ≤-hCG concentrations were 0.36 ng/g crea. (creatinine) and 17736 mIU/ml, respectively. Across the BPA tertiles, the differences in mean values were not significant for none of the anthropometric measurements and gestational age (GA). Furthermore, no significant association existed between unadjusted and adjusted tertiles of BPA and Œ≤-hCG with abovementioned birth outcomes. It seems that the non-significant association found in this study is because of low levels of urinary BPA levels than in other studies; the adverse effects on infants might be related to high concentration of BPA passed from placenta. Future longitudinal studies with large sample size are necessary to document the adverse health effects of maternal exposure to endocrine disruptor chemicals including BPA.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Phenols,bisphenol A",,"Animals,Female,Gestational Age,Gonadal Steroid Hormones,Labor, Obstetric,Luteinizing Hormone,Pelvis,Pregnancy,Progesterone,Rats,Rats, Inbred Strains,Relaxin"
35700937,-103,,,Effects of bisphenol A and estradiol in adult rat testis after prepubertal and pubertal exposure.,"Over the past few decades, male fertility has been decreasing worldwide. Many studies attribute this outcome to endocrine disruptors exposure such as bisphenol A (BPA), which is a chemical compound used in plastics synthesis and exhibiting estrogenic activity. In order to assess how the window of exposure modulates the effects of BPA on the testis, prepubertal (15 dpp to 30 dpp) and pubertal (60 dpp to 75 dpp) male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to BPA (50¬†¬µg/kg bw/day), 17-Œ≤-estradiol (E2) (20¬†¬µg/kg bw/day) as a positive control, or to a combination of these compounds. For both periods of exposure, the rats were sacrificed and their testes were collected at 75 dpp. The histological analysis and the quantification of the gene expression of testis cell markers by RT-qPCR confirmed the complete spermatogenesis in all groups for both periods of exposure. However, our results suggest a deleterious effect of BPA on the blood-testis barrier in adults after pubertal exposure as BPA and BPA+E2 treatments induced a decrease in caveolin-1 and connexin-43 gene expression; which are proteins of the junctional complexes. As none of these effects were found after a prepubertal exposure, these results suggested the reversibility of BPA's effects. Caution must be taken when transposing this finding to humans and further studies are needed in this regard. However, from a regulatory perspective, this study emphasizes the importance of taking into account different periods of exposure, as they present different sensitivities to BPA exposure.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Phenols,Estradiol,bisphenol A",,"Animals,Female,Gonads,Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System,Male,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Receptors, Estrogen,Sexual Behavior, Animal,Sexual Maturation"

The present study characterized the effects of the acute and chronic administration of PCP on the release of adrenocorticotropin, corticosterone and prolactin in the rat. For the acute studies, PCP hydrochloride (0.5-10.0 mg/kg s.c.) was administered and the subjects were sacrificed 15 to 300 min later. The acute administration of PCP produced rapid and long-lasting increases in plasma levels of adrenocorticotropin and corticosterone but decreased plasma levels of prolactin. For the chronic studies, PCP (1.0-20.0 mg/kg/day s.c.) was injected daily and the subjects sacrificed 60 min after injection on day 15. PCP continued to stimulate the pituitary-adrenal axis after chronic administration; however, there was a decrease in the magnitude of response, indicating the development of some degree of tolerance. In contrast, none of the doses of PCP tested decreased plasma prolactin levels in chronically treated subjects. There were no differences in plasma or brain levels of PCP in the chronically PCP-treated rats, indicating that tolerance was not due to changes in the biodisposition of PCP. These results indicate that PCP disrupts neuroendocrine function markedly in the rat. The differential development of tolerance to the effects of PCP on the pituitary-adrenal axis and prolactin release may indicate that different neurochemical substrates underlie the effects of PCP on different endocrine systems.","Receptors, Neurotransmitter,Receptors, Opioid,Receptors, Phencyclidine,Receptors, sigma,Adrenocorticotropic Hormone,Prolactin,Phencyclidine,Corticosterone","biomonitoring,endocrine disruptors,hair,triclosan","Animals,Female,Hair,Hair Analysis,Humans,Male,Pilot Projects,Poland,Triclosan"
35894097,-103,,,Naphthenic acid fraction components from oil sands process-affected water from the Athabasca Oil Sands Region impair murine osteoblast differentiation and function.,"The extraction of bitumen from surface mining in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) produces large quantities of oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) that needs to be stored in settling basins near extraction sites. Chemical constituents of OSPW are known to impair bone health in some organisms, which can lead to increased fracture risk and lower reproductive fitness. Naphthenic acid fraction components (NAFCs) are thought to be among the most toxic class of compounds in OSPW; however, the effect of NAFCs on osteoblast development is largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that NAFCs from OSPW inhibit osteoblast differentiation and deposition of extracellular matrix, which is required for bone formation. Extracellular matrix deposition was inhibited in osteoblasts exposed to 12.5-125‚Äâmg/L of NAFC for 21‚Äâdays. We also show that components within NAFCs inhibit the expression of gene markers of osteoblast differentiation and function, namely, alkaline phosphatase (Alp), osteocalcin, and collagen type 1 alpha 1 (Col1a1). These effects were partially mediated by the induction of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activity; NAFC induces the expression of the GR activity marker genes Sgk1 (12.5¬†mg/L) and p85a (125‚Äâmg/L) and inhibits GR protein (125‚Äâmg/L) and Opg RNA (12.5¬†mg/L) expression. This study provides evidence that NAFC concentrations of 12.5¬†mg/L and above can directly act on osteoblasts to inhibit bone formation and suggests that NAFCs contain components that can act as GR agonists, which may have further endocrine disrupting effects on exposed wildlife.","naphthenic acid,Water Pollutants, Chemical,Carboxylic Acids,Water","Chemical,Neurodevelopment,Neurotoxicant,Prenatal,Sexually dimorphic,Stress","Animals,Female,Hazardous Substances,Humans,Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System,Neurosecretory Systems,Pituitary-Adrenal System,Pregnancy,Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects,Sex Characteristics,Stress, Psychological"
34339697,-103,,,Urinary glyphosate concentration in pregnant women in relation to length of gestation.,"Human exposure to glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH) is increasing rapidly worldwide. Most existing studies on health effects of glyphosate have focused on occupational settings and cancer outcomes and few have examined this common exposure in relation to the health of pregnant women and newborns in the general population. We investigated associations between prenatal glyphosate exposure and length of gestation in The Infant Development and the Environment Study (TIDES), a multi-center US pregnancy cohort. Glyphosate and its primary degradation product [aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA)] were measured in urine samples collected during the second trimester from 163 pregnant women: 69 preterm births (<37 weeks) and 94 term births, the latter randomly selected as a subset of TIDES term births. We examined the relationship between exposure and length of gestation using multivariable logistic regression models (dichotomous outcome; term versus preterm) and with weighted time-to-event Cox proportional hazards models (gestational age in days). We conducted these analyses in the overall sample and secondarily, restricted to women with spontaneous deliveries (n¬†=¬†90). Glyphosate and AMPA were detected in most urine samples (>94¬†%). A shortened gestational length was associated with maternal glyphosate (hazard ratio (HR): 1.31, 95¬†% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.71) and AMPA (HR: 1.32, 95%CI: 1.00-1.73) only among spontaneous deliveries using adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. In binary analysis, glyphosate and AMPA were not associated with preterm birth risk (<37 weeks). Our results indicate widespread exposure to glyphosate in the general population which may impact reproductive health by shortening length of gestation. Given the increasing exposure to GBHs and the public health burden of preterm delivery, larger confirmatory studies are needed, especially in vulnerable populations such as pregnant women and newborns.","Herbicides,glyphosate,Glycine","Ecosystem,Endocrine disruptors,Environmental health,Human health,OCPs,Pesticides","Animals,Female,Humans,Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated,Infant, Newborn,Milk,Pesticides,Placenta,Pregnancy"
33721218,-103,,,Diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) regulates the proliferation and chemosensitivity of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells via regulation of PTEN.,"As one of the most prevalent and deadly cancers worldwide, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) can be directly exposed to endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC). As a potential EDC, diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) can trigger the development of various cancers, while the potential effect of DEHP on the ESCC progression was not clear. Our present study revealed that DEHP can trigger the proliferation of ESCC cells and decrease the cisplatin (CDDP) and fluorouracil (5-FU) sensitivity. Mechanistical studies indicated that DEHP can decrease the transcription of PTEN, a well-characterized tumor suppressor, in ESCC cells. Over expression of PTEN can reverse DEHP-regulated ESCC cell proliferation and chemosensitivity. Further, DEHP can increase the expression of HES-1, which can bind with the promoter of PTEN to inhibit its transcription. Collectively, DEHP can increase proliferation while decrease chemosensitivity of ESCC cells via regulation of HES-1/PTEN axis. Further, daily expression of DEHP may be a potent risk factor for ESCC development.","Antineoplastic Agents,Endocrine Disruptors,Transcription Factor HES-1,HES1 protein, human,Diethylhexyl Phthalate,PTEN Phosphohydrolase,PTEN protein, human,Cisplatin,Fluorouracil",,"Animals,Female,Humans,Infant,Male,Maternal Behavior,Membrane Proteins,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mother-Child Relations,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Weaning"

Few human studies have evaluated the effects of ISO exposure on neonatal anthropometry. This study aimed to examine the associations of maternal soy product consumption and urinary ISO concentrations, including genistein, daidzein, glycitein, and equol, with neonatal anthropometry, based on a Chinese cohort study. In Shanghai-Minhang Birth Cohort Study, pregnant women at 12-16 weeks of gestation were recruited, and they completed a structured questionnaire to assess soy product consumption during pregnancy. They also provided a single spot urine sample for the ISO assay. Neonatal anthropometric indices (birth weight; arm, waist, and head circumference; and triceps, back, and abdominal skinfold thickness) were measured at birth. Multivariable linear regression analysis was performed among the 1188 mother-infant pairs to examine the associations between maternal soy product consumption and neonatal anthropometry. The same statistical model was applied to examine the associations between maternal ISO exposure and neonatal anthropometry among 480 mother-infant pairs. Neonate girls born to mothers who ""sometimes"" and ""frequent"" consumed soy products had 169.1¬†g (95% confidence interval [CI],¬†-68.9-407.1) and 256.5¬†g (95% CI, 17.1-495.8) higher birth weight, respectively, than those born to mothers who ""never"" consumed soy products during pregnancy. We observed consistent associations between higher maternal urine ISO concentrations and increased anthropometric indices (birth weight, arm and waist circumference, and triceps and abdominal skinfold thickness) in neonate girls, while no association was observed among boys. The findings suggested that maternal dietary ISO intake during pregnancy is associated with fetal development in a sex-specific pattern.

In the present study, while B[a]P and B[a]P-7,8-diol were not able to induce cell death, exposure to BPDE resulted in cell death. BPDE-induced cell death is accompanied by the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-7. Depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane and cytochrome c release from mitochondria were observed in benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide (BPDE)-treated cells. These results indicate that TM4 cells are susceptible to apoptosis in a caspase-dependent manner. Western blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses showed that aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) expression was almost undetectable in TM4 cells and that its expression was not altered after B[a]P treatment. This indicates that TM4 cells are nearly AhR-deficient. In TM4 cells, the CYP1A1 protein and its activity were not present. From these results, it is clear that AhR may be a prerequisite for CYP1A1 expression in TM4 cells. Therefore, TM4 cells can be referred to as CYP1A1-deficient cells. Thus, TM4 Sertoli cells are believed to have a rigid and protective cellular machinery against genotoxic agents. In conclusion, it is suggested that tolerance to B[a]P cytotoxicity is associated with insufficient AhR and CYP1A1 expression in testicular Sertoli cells.'}",,,"Animals,Female,Light,Luteinizing Hormone,Melatonin,Periodicity,Pineal Gland,Reproduction,Seasons,Sheep"
31945527,-103,,,Integration of proteomics and metabolomics reveals promotion of proliferation by exposure of bisphenol S in human breast epithelial MCF-10A cells.,"Bisphenol S (BPS) has been reported to have similar estrogenic effects as bisphenol A (BPA). Considering the endocrine disrupting effects of BPS, in this study, we investigated the effects of BPS exposure on normal human breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A by using mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics and quantitative proteomics. We found that exposure to BPS for 24¬†h altered the proliferation of MCF-10A cells in a hormetic manner with the highest proliferation rate at the dosage of 1¬†ŒºM. A total of 200 proteins were identified to be significantly changed by 1¬†ŒºM of BPS exposure. The upregulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Ras/mTOR-related proteins implied that EGFR-mediated pathways were involved in BPS-induced proliferation of MCF-10A cells. In addition, several proliferation-related protein markers were found to be elevated, such as MKI67 and CDH1, further indicating the promotion of proliferation by low dose of BPS exposure. Besides, 35 endogenous metabolites were found to be significantly changed. The joint pathway analysis of the altered metabolites and proteins suggested changes in pathways of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, purine metabolism, pyruvate metabolism and lipid metabolism, which were involved in sustaining cell proliferation and cellular signal transduction. Taken together, this study provides insights into the effects and the potential mechanisms of BPS on estrogen receptor Œ±-negative normal breast cell line MCF-10A, broadening our knowledge about the risk of using BPS as the alternative of BPA.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Phenols,Sulfones,bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)sulfone","artificial light at night,invasive species,life history,lizard,reproduction,urbanization","Animals,Female,Lighting,Lizards,Male,Reproduction"
33012732,-103,,,Prenatal and postnatal bisphenol A exposure inhibits postnatal neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus.,"Bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine disruptor with estrogenic effects, is widely used as a raw material for manufacturing polycarbonate plastic and epoxy resins. Prenatal and postnatal exposure to BPA affects brain morphogenesis. However, the effects of prenatal and postnatal BPA exposure on postnatal neurogenesis in mice are poorly understood. In this study, we developed a mouse model of prenatal and postnatal BPA exposure and analyzed its effects on hippocampal neurogenesis. The hippocampal dentate gyrus is vulnerable to chemical exposure, as neurogenesis continues in this region even after birth. Our results showed that in mice, prenatal and postnatal BPA exposure decreased the number of type-1, 2a, 2b, and 3 neural progenitor cells, as well as in granule cells, in the hippocampal dentate gyrus on postnatal days 16 and 70. The effect of prenatal and postnatal BPA exposure on neural progenitors were affected at all differentiation stages. In addition, prenatal and postnatal BPA exposure affects the maintenance of long-term memory on postnatal day 70. Our results suggest that neurodevelopmental toxicity due to prenatal and postnatal BPA exposure might affect postnatal morphogenesis and functional development of the hippocampal dentate gyrus.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Phenols,bisphenol A","Endocrine disruptor,Estrogen,Maternal behavior,Nervous system,Oxytocin,Phthalates","Animals,Female,Male,Mice,Diethylhexyl Phthalate,Endocrine Disruptors,Estrogen Receptor alpha,Lactation,Maternal Behavior,Maternal Exposure,Oxytocin,Plasticizers,Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects"
35932513,-103,,,Reproductive disruption in adult female and male rats prenatally exposed to mesquite pod extract or daidzein.,"Phytoestrogens are considered to be endocrine disruptors, since they can alter the endocrine system, thus disturbing many reproductive events. The intake of diets containing a high content of phytoestrogens has increased worldwide in human populations and in domestic animals. Phytoestrogens in maternal blood can pass through the placenta to the fetus in high amounts and can have long-term organizational effects. Mesquite (Prosopis sp) is a leguminous plant widely used to feed several livestock species, and is also used in the human diet. In this study we assessed the effects of exposure to mesquite pod extract during the periconception and pregnancy periods on the reproduction of male and female descendants. The females of three experimental groups received one of the following treatments: 1) vehicle injection; 2) mesquite pod extract or 3) the isoflavone daidzein during the periconception and pregnancy periods. Estrous cyclicity, sexual behavior and hormones, as well as uterine and vaginal epithelia were evaluated in the female descendants. In the males, sexual behavior and hormones, apoptosis in testicular cells and sperm quality were evaluated. In females the following was observed: alterations in estrous cycles, decreased sexual behavior, estradiol and progesterone levels, increased uterine and vaginal epithelia. In males, we observed a decrease in sexual behavior, testosterone and sperm quality, and apoptosis increased in testicular cells. All these effects were similar to those caused by daidzein. These results indicate that prenatal exposure to mesquite pod extract or daidzein, administered to females before and during pregnancy, can disrupt normal organizational-activational programming of reproductive physiology in female and male descendants.","Isoflavones,Phytoestrogens,Plant Extracts,Estradiol,daidzein","Cx3cr1-Dtr,hypothalamus,luteinising hormone,macrophages,microglia,ovarian reserve","Animals,Female,Microglia,Monocytes,Ovarian Follicle,Ovary,Rats,Rats, Wistar"
35439602,-103,,,Nonylphenol exposure-induced oocyte quality deterioration could be reversed by melatonin supplementation in mice.,"Nonylphenol (NP) belongs to the metabolites of commercial detergents, which acts as an environmental endocrine disruptor. NP is reported to have multiple toxicity including reproductive toxicity. In present study, we reported the protective effects of melatonin on the NP-exposed oocyte quality. We set up a mouse in vivo model of NP exposure (500¬†Œºg/L), by daily drinking and continued feeding for 4 weeks; and we gave a daily dose of melatonin (30¬†mg/kg) to the NP-exposed mice. Melatonin supplementation restores the development ability of oocytes exposed to NP, and this was due to the reduction of ROS level and DNA damage by melatonin. Melatonin could rescue aberrant mitochondria distribution, mitochondria membrane potential, which also was reflected by ATP content and mtDNA copy number. Moreover, melatonin could restore the RPS3 expression to ensure the ribosome function for protein synthesis, and reduced GRP78 protein level to protect against ER stress and ER distribution defects. We also found that vesicle protein Rab11 from Golgi apparatus was protected by melatonin at the spindle periphery of oocytes of NP-exposed mice, which further moderated LAMP2 for lysosome function. Our results indicate that melatonin protects oocytes from NP exposure through its effects on the reduction of oxidative stress and DNA damage, which might be through its amelioration on the organelles in mice.","Phenols,Reactive Oxygen Species,nonylphenol,Melatonin","Fenoxycarb,Juvenile hormone analogue,Primary cell culture,Resazurin assay,Spodoptera mauritia","Animals,Female,Spodoptera,Primary Cell Culture,Phenylcarbamates,Juvenile Hormones"

We analyzed data (1999-2017) on 1,120 premenopausal women from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN). Causal mediation analysis was applied to quantify the degree to which follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels could mediate the associations between PFAS and incident natural menopause. Participants with higher PFAS concentrations had shorter times to natural menopause, with a relative survival of 0.82 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.69, 0.96) for linear perfluorooctane sulfonate (n-PFOS), 0.84 (95% CI: 0.69, 1.00) for sum of branched-chain perfluorooctane sulfonate (Sm-PFOS), 0.79 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.93) for linear-chain perfluorooctanoate (n-PFOA), and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.71, 0.97) for perfluorononanoate (PFNA), comparing the highest tertile of PFAS concentrations with the lowest. The proportion of the effect mediated through FSH was 8.5% (95% CI: -11.7, 24.0) for n-PFOS, 13.2% (95% CI: 0.0, 24.5) for Sm-PFOS, 26.9% (95% CI: 15.6, 38.4) for n-PFOA, and 21.7% (6.8, 37.0) for PFNA. No significant mediation by estradiol was observed. The effect of PFAS on natural menopause may be partially explained by variations in FSH concentrations.","Alkanesulfonic Acids,Environmental Pollutants,Fluorocarbons,Gonadal Steroid Hormones,Estradiol,Follicle Stimulating Hormone",,"Animals,Fibroblast Growth Factors,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Humans,Hypothalamus,Models, Biological,Neurosecretory Systems,Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor,Signal Transduction"

It was found that tissue reparation after trophic disorders and cell death triggered by prenatal and postnatal exposure to DDT was accompanied by an increase in the number of Oct4- and Shh-expressing cells forming a pool located outside the regeneration zones and involved in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis in the zona fasciculata. DDT exposure also disrupted the expression of antiproliferative factor Hhex. The data showed that proliferation of fasciculata cells after termination of adrenal cortex growth was downregulated by inhibition of the expression of Oct4 and Shh and suppression of canonical Wnt signaling, i.e. due to a decrease in the reserve cell pool essential for physiological regeneration, which can reduce the reactive potential of the zona fasciculata.","Endocrine Disruptors,Hedgehog Proteins,Hhex protein, rat,Homeodomain Proteins,Octamer Transcription Factor-3,Pou5f1 protein, rat,Shh protein, rat,DDT","FGF,cancer,development,nonmalignant pathology,physiology,prostate","Animals,Fibroblast Growth Factors,Humans,Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins,Male,Prostate,Prostatic Diseases,Prostatic Neoplasms,Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor"

Previous studies have reported the adverse effects of CPF, such as intoxication incidents, endocrine disruption, cardiovascular diseases, as well as histopathological and oxidative damage. The aims of the present study were to elucidate short time subacute toxicity of CPF in male rats. Sprague-Dawley male rats (n¬†=‚Äâ32) were divided into four groups (n¬†=‚Äâ8) and received CPF as 3.25‚Äâmg/kg body weight (b.w) (Group A), 6.75‚Äâmg/kg b.w (Group B), 13.5¬†mg/kg b.w (Group C), and corn oil (control or Group D) daily via gavage for 15‚Äâdays. The rats were sacrificed and oxidative damages, pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-Œ±, IL-1Œ≤), and histopathological changes were determined in the lung, liver, kidney, heart, and testis tissues as well as plasma. According to our result, administration of CPF caused a significant increase in malondialdehid level and catalase activity while a significant decrease in superoxide dismutase activity in all tissues. In addition, a significant decrease in TNF-Œ± observed in all tissues and plasma duo to the CPF. Histopathological evaluation of CPF-treated samples revealed a dose-dependent tissue toxicity in the liver, heart, lung, and kidney with less sensitivity of testicular and kidney tissues. These results suggest the potential of CPF in inducing oxidative stress at low doses and short duration time with similar trends in different tissues. As well as, due to the effects of CPF on some pro-inflammatory mediators, more comprehensive studies are recommended.","Antioxidants,Cytokines,Organophosphorus Compounds,Pesticides,Chlorpyrifos",,"Animals,Gastric Acid,Gastrins,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Models, Biological,Receptor, Cholecystokinin B,Signal Transduction"
31975012,-103,,,Urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites during gestation and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy: a population-based birth cohort study.,"Phthalates, a class of widely used endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), are toxic to various organ systems in animals and humans. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is a reversible liver dysfunction causing cholestasis in late pregnancy. Evidence on the associations between exposure to phthalates and ICP is still lacking. In the present study, we investigated the relationships between urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites and the risk of ICP in a Chinese population-based birth cohort. Pregnant women participated in the Ma'anshan Birth Cohort (MABC) study in China. Seven phthalate metabolites were detected in a urine sample in early pregnancy. Chemical concentrations were grouped by quartiles, and associations with outcomes were examined using logistic regression with adjustment for urine creatinine, race, education, poverty status, smoking status, alcohol consumption, maternal age, prepregnancy body mass index (BMI), parity, twin pregnancy, and pregnancy-related liver complications. Of 3474 women recruited into the Ma'anshan Birth Cohort, 2760 met the inclusion criteria and contributed to further analysis and biomonitoring data. Elevated odds ratios (ORs) of ICP were observed in the highest quartiles of monomethyl phthalate (MMP) exposure (OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.59, 95% confidence intervals (CI)‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.01-2.51) and monobutyl phthalate (MBP) exposure (OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.82, 95% CI‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.16-2.85) in the adjusted analyses.

In women with uterine fibroids, there is a correlation between blood Cd levels and fibroid tumor size. In this study, fibroid cells were exposed to 10 ¬µM CdCl for 6 months and a fast-growing Cd-Resistant Leiomyoma culture, termed CR-LM6, was recovered. To characterize the morphological and mechanodynamic features of uterine fibroid cells associated with prolonged Cd exposure, we conducted time lapse imaging using a Zeiss confocal microscope and analyzed data by Imaris and RStudio. Our experiments recorded more than 64,000 trackable nuclear surface objects, with each having multiple parameters such as nuclear size and shape, speed, location, orientation, track length, and track straightness. Quantitative analysis revealed that prolonged Cd exposure significantly altered cell migration behavior, such as increased track length and reduced track straightness. Cd exposure also significantly increased the heterogeneity in nuclear size. Additionally, Cd significantly increased the median and variance of instantaneous speed, indicating that Cd exposure results in higher speed and greater variation in motility. Profiling of mRNA by NanoString analysis and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) strongly suggested that the direction of gene expression changes due to Cd exposure enhanced cell movement and invasion. The altered expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) genes such as collagens, matrix metallopeptidases (MMPs), secreted phosphoprotein 1 (), which are important for migration contact guidance, may be responsible for the greater heterogeneity. The significantly increased heterogeneity of nuclear size, speed, and altered migration patterns may be a prerequisite for fibroid cells to attain characteristics favorable for cancer progression, invasion, and metastasis.'}",,,"Animals,Gene Editing,Genes, Duplicate,Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 2,Insulin-Like Growth Factor I,Oncorhynchus mykiss"
35588983,-103,,,Deoxynivalenol enhances estrogen receptor alpha-induced signaling by ligand-independent transactivation.,"Deoxynivalenol (DON), which is one of the prevalent mycotoxins in food and feeds, exerts adverse effects on animal and human health. These effects are mainly associated with its ribotoxic properties, although few studies suggest the involvement of other mechanisms of action. To assess the ability of DON to disrupt estrogen signaling, we conducted an in vitro study using MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231¬†cells. After 72h, DON reduced cell viability in both cell lines, thus highlighting its well-known cytotoxic effect. However, after 6h, DON increased the expression of estrogen-responsive genes, hence demonstrating the stimulation of estrogen signaling by this mycotoxin after a short-term exposure. This effect was partially reversed by siRNA-mediated silencing of ERŒ± expression and by 4-hydroxytamoxifen (ERŒ± antagonist), but neither by G36 (GPER antagonist) nor by the siRNA-mediated silencing of PPARŒ≥2 expression. Moreover, DON exposure induced an increase in the level of ERŒ± phosphorylation at serine 167. Furthermore, when combined with zearalenone (a naturally co-occurring mycotoxin recognized as an endocrine disruptor), DON increased the expression of estrogen-responsive genes to a greater extent than each individual compound taken separately. Taken together, our results suggest, for the first time, that DON can disrupt estrogen signaling through the ligand-independent activation of ERŒ±.","Estrogen Receptor alpha,Estrogens,Ligands,Mycotoxins,RNA, Small Interfering,Trichothecenes,Zearalenone,deoxynivalenol","Toxicity,Transcriptome analysis,Triazinone herbicide,Triazole fungicide","Animals,Gene Expression Profiling,Oligochaeta,Soil,Soil Pollutants,Triazines,Triazoles"

34706627,-102,,,Systems toxicology approach explores target-pathway relationship and adverse health impacts of ubiquitous environmental pollutant bisphenol A.,"The effects of environmental chemicals on health outcomes may be underestimated due to deficiency of knowledge regarding the actions of compounds on toxico-pathogenic mechanisms underlying biological systems outcomes. In this regard, the current study aimed to explore the potential target-pathway-disease relationship attributed to bisphenol A (BPA) responses in target tissues. Computational methods including reverse pharmacophore mapping approach, structural similarity based search and kinome wide interaction profiling were employed with molecular docking validation. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network based illustrations were utilized to prioritize target-pathway and disease relationships. Data illustrated that BPA possessed multi-target nature since this chemical potentially interacted with various protein targets where many of these were validated through docking. Potential BPA targets were significantly enriched to various cellular signaling pathways including steroid biosynthesis, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR‚ÑΩ) and cancer. Further, hypertension was prioritized as disease target. In addition, BPA targeted 17 cell signaling kinases encompassed in the human kinome. In addition, inflammatory (5-LO) and apoptosis regulators (Bcl-X and Bcl-2) were also explored as novel targets. Evidence indicates that the multi-target nature and plausible mechanisms underlying BPA actions in a system wide manner aids toward understanding of adverse effects. This observation may lead us to more precise method to elucidate the toxico-pathogenic mechanisms of BPA with an environmental health perspective.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Pollutants,Phenols,Proteome,bisphenol A",,"Animals,Goiter,Methimazole,Phenylthiourea,Prealbumin,Radioimmunoassay,Sea Bream,Thioamides,Thiourea,Thyroid Gland,Thyroid Hormones"

However, limited studies have been carried out on mixed exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), especially in human breast cancer. Therefore, using MCF7 human breast cancer cells, we investigated the effects of coexposure to MEHP (mono 2-ethylhexyl phthalate) and TCDD (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) on cell migration and invasion, as well as the roles of AhR and the MMP/slug pathway. Our data suggest that MEHP or TCDD can induce migration and invasion in MCF7 cells, and the promotion is partly AhR dependent. We also observed that MEHP antagonized TCDD to reduce AhR-mediated CYP1A1 expression. Subsequently, we revealed that MEHP recruited AhR to dioxin response element (DRE) sequences and decreased TCDD-induced AhR-DRE binding in CYP1A1 genes. Overall, MEHP is a potential AHR agonist, capable of decreasing TCDD-induced AhR-DRE binding in CYP1A1 genes. The antagonizing effect of coexposure led to the inhibition of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in MCF7 cells.

Consequently, BPS and BPF were frequently detected in surface water, sediment, sewage effluent, indoor dust, and even in food and biological fluids in humans. Thus, environmental researches start to focus on the potential environmental risks of BPA alternatives. While the estrogenically active metabolites and the specific estrogenically active structure are still unknown. In this study, the MTT assay on acute cytotoxicity and the recombinant transactivation assay were carried out to determine whether BPF and BPS are suitable alternatives to BPA. Our results show that the cytotoxic and estrogenic activities of BPS and BPF are lower than those of BPA. However, after the addition of a rat liver homogenate to simulate mammal metabolism, BPF exhibited higher estrogenic activity than BPA. To identify the chemical structures and estrogen receptor binding affinities of active estrogenic metabolites, LC-MS, MetaPrint2D(-React), and VirtualToxLab were integrated. The observed results indicated that the para-hydroxylated BPF and BPF-OCH might have strong ER binding affinities.

Although exposure to DEHP has raised many health concerns due to the identification of DEHP as an endocrine disruptor, it is still used in consumer products, including polyvinyl chloride plastics, medical tubing, car interiors, and children's toys. To investigate the impact of early life exposure to DEHP on the ovary and testes, newborn piglets were orally dosed with DEHP (20 or 200‚Äâmg/kg/day) or vehicle control (tocopherol-stripped corn oil) for 21 days. Following treatment, ovaries, testes, and sera were harvested for histological assessment and measurement of steroid hormone levels. In male piglets, progesterone and pregnenolone levels were significantly lower in both treatment groups compared to control, whereas in female piglets, progesterone was significantly higher in the 20‚Äâmg group compared to control, indicating sex-specific effects in a non-monotonic manner. Follicle numbers and gene expression of steroidogenic enzymes and apoptotic factors were not altered in treated ovaries compared to controls. In DEHP-treated testes, germ cell migration was impaired and germ cell death was significantly increased compared to controls. Overall, the results of this study suggest that neonatal exposure to DEHP in pigs leads to sex-specific disruption of the reproductive system.","Endocrine Disruptors,Gonadal Steroid Hormones,Diethylhexyl Phthalate","Autotomy,Fitness,Flexibility of defense responses,Genetic correlation with behavior,Recovery condition,Survival response","Animals,Humans,Immobility Response, Tonic,Mammals"
34182286,-102,,,Transcriptomic changes upon epoxiconazole exposure in a human stem cell-based model of developmental toxicity.,"Conazole fungicides such as epoxiconazole are mostly used on cereals of crops to inhibit fungal growth through direct inhibition of sterol 14Œ±-demethylase (CYP51A1). However, this enzyme is highly conserved and in humans it is part of the steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway. Endocrine disrupting effects of epoxiconazole have been shown in rodents and have been substantiated by in vitro data, however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not clear. We took advantage of a human stem cell based in vitro model for developmental toxicity to study the molecular effects of epoxiconazole. This model is based on 3D cultures of embryoid bodies and differentiation into cardiomyocytes, which mimics the early stages of embryonic development. We have previously shown that epoxiconazole impairs differentiation of these embryoid bodies and therefore has the potential to affect human embryonic development. We employed global transcriptome analysis using RNA sequencing and found that the steroid biosynthesis pathway including CYP51A1, the human sterol 14Œ±-demethylase, was highly deregulated by epoxiconazole in our model. We confirmed that most genes of the steroid biosynthesis pathway were upregulated, including CYP51A1, suggesting a compensatory mechanism at the gene expression level.

However, as per experimental and epidemiological data, widespread and irrational or long-term use of paracetamol may be harmful to human endocrine homeostasis, especially during pregnancy. Some researchers suggest that prenatal exposure to paracetamol might alter fetal development and also enhance the risk of reproductive disorders. An imbalance in the levels of these hormones may play a significant role in the emergence of various diseases, including infertility. Therefore, in this study, the interaction mechanism of paracetamol with reproductive hormone receptors was investigated by molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) for assessing paracetamol's potency to disrupt reproductive hormones. The results indicate that paracetamol has the ability to interact with reproductive hormone receptors (estrogen 1XP9; 1QKM with binding energy of -5.61‚Äâkcal/mol; -5.77‚Äâkcal/mol; androgen 5CJ6‚Äâ-‚Äâ5.63‚Äâkcal/mol; and progesterone 4OAR -5.60‚Äâkcal/mol) by hydrogen bonds as well as hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions to maintain its stability.

11855907,-102,,,Resveratrol: phytoestrogen effects on reproductive physiology and behavior in female rats.,"Resveratrol is a phytoestrogen naturally found in grapes and is a major constituent of wine thought to exert both cardioprotective and chemopreventive activities. Recent studies show that this bioflavonoid binds to and activates gene transcription via the estrogen receptor (ER) subtypes ERalpha and ERbeta. Previous studies have focused primarily on the in vitro effects of resveratrol (RES) in estrogen-sensitive tissues or in carcinogenic cell lines, while frequently neglecting to document its potential effects in animal models with intact neuroendocrine systems. However, the present studies were designed to systematically characterize the in vivo effects of RES on reproductive physiology and behavior in adult female rats. In gonadally intact females, RES consumption reduced body weight, disrupted estrous cyclicity, and induced ovarian hypertrophy. However, in ovariectomized females RES (10-1000 microg) injections did not appear to mimic 17 beta-estradiol benzoate (EB)-induced behavioral responses and had no lasting effects on subsequent estrogen sensitivity or sociosexual behavior. The present studies support recent in vitro findings that RES differs from other phytoestrogens by acting as a possible mixed agonist/antagonist, depending on the availability of specific ER isoforms localized in the reproductive tract and brain of the female rat.","Estrogens,Estrogens, Non-Steroidal,Isoflavones,Phytoestrogens,Plant Preparations,Stilbenes,Estradiol,Resveratrol","SENP protease,SUMO,SUMO ligase,cancer,congenital birth defects,heart development,heart failure,neural tube,neurodegenerative disease,spina bifida.","Animals,Humans,Molecular Targeted Therapy,Signal Transduction,Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins,Sumoylation"

In humans, hypothyroxinemia early in pregnancy is associated with adverse effects on the developing nervous system and can lead to impaired cognitive function and motor development in children. The aim of the present study was therefore to assess whether perinatal mancozeb exposure would cause developmental neurotoxicity in rats. Groups of 9-21 time-mated Wistar rats were dosed with 0, 50, 100, or 150 mg mancozeb/kg body weight (bw)/day by gavage from gestation day (GD) 7 to postnatal day (PND) 16, and total thyroxine (T(4)) levels were measured in dams during gestation. On PND 16, hormone levels and several organ weights were measured in the offspring, whereas motor activity, startle response, and cognitive function were assessed in the adult offspring. The dose of 150 mg/kg/day caused neurotoxicity in the pregnant dams and was therefore reduced to 100 mg/kg bw/day in mid study. T(4) levels showed a dose-dependent and significant decrease in dams from all three dose groups on GD 15, whereas offspring T(4) levels, thyroid weights, and histology were unaffected on PND 16. No effects on reproductive organ weights were seen, and no behavioral changes were observed. Taken together, these results indicate that in rats, moderate maternal hypothyroxinemia during gestation does not necessarily lead to hyperactivity or reduced special learning abilities in the offspring. Mancozeb exposure did, however, reduce T(4) levels in dams and may therefore still be a potential contributor to thyroid disruption in humans and in result adversely affects the developing brain.","Endocrine Disruptors,Fungicides, Industrial,Thyroid Hormones,Maneb,mancozeb,Zineb","abdominal obesity,endocrinology disrupting chemicals,obesity,pediatric obesity","Anthropometry,Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Exposure,Humans,Obesity"

We saw no evidence of effect modification by couples' age on associations between TTP and urinary phthalate or BPA metabolite concentrations. Across the EDCs we examined, we found little evidence that age modifies TTP-exposure associations.","Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Pollutants,Cotinine","adrenocortical carcinoma,endocrine neoplasms,immune checkpoint inhibitors,immune escape,neuroendocrine tumors,ovarian cancer,pancreatic adenocarcinoma,thyroid cancer","Antibodies, Monoclonal,Endocrine Gland Neoplasms,Humans,Immunotherapy"
35254616,-101,,,Autism spectrum disorder-like behavior induced in rat offspring by perinatal exposure to di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate.,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD), also known as childhood autism, is a common neurological developmental disorder. Although it is generally believed that genetic factors are a primary cause for ASD development, more and more studies show that an increasing number of ASD diagnoses are related to environmental exposure. Epidemiological studies indicated that perinatal exposure to endocrine disruptors might cause neurodevelopmental disorders in children. Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is widely used as a plasticizer in many products. To explore the neurodevelopmental effect induced by perinatal exposure to DEHP on rat offspring, and the potential mechanisms, female Wistar rats were exposed to 1, 10, and 100¬†mg/kg/day DEHP during pregnancy and lactation, while valproic acid (VPA) was used as a positive control. The behavior tests showed that rat pups exposed to VPA and 100¬†mg/kg/day DEHP were not good as those from the control group in both their socialability and social novelty. Expression of mTOR pathway-related components increased while the number of autophagosomes decreased in the brain tissue of the rat offspring exposed to 100¬†mg/kg/day DEHP. In addition, perinatal exposure to DEHP at all dosages decreased the level of autophagy proteins LC3II and Beclin1 in the brain tissue of rat pups. Our results indicated that perinatal DEHP exposure would induce ASD-like behavioral changes in rat offspring, which might be mediated by activation of the mTOR signaling pathway, and inhibition of autophagy in the brain.","Phthalic Acids,phthalic acid,Diethylhexyl Phthalate,TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases",,"Antidepressive Agents,Biogenic Monoamines,Depressive Disorder,Humans"

Bisphenol A (BPA) is a pollutant, classified as an endocrine-disrupting chemical compound with estrogenic properties, their exposure in the early stages of neonatal life leads to an increase in the size and weight of breast tumors and induces cellular changes in the tumoral immune microenvironment where cytokines play a key role. Thus, we used female BALB/c mice exposed neonatally to a single dose of BPA. Once mice reached sexual maturity, a mammary tumor was induced, injecting 4T1 cells in situ. After 25 days of injection, we evaluated endocrine alterations, cytokine expression, tissue alterations denoted by macro or micro-metastasis in the lung, and cell infiltration induced by metastasis. We found that BPA neonatal treatment did not show significant endocrine alterations. Noteworthy, BPA led to an augmented rate of metastasis to the lung associated with higher intratumoral expression of IL-1Œ≤, IL-6, IFN-Œ≥, TNF-Œ±, and VEGF. Our data suggest that cytokines are key players in the induction of BC metastasis and that BPA (an environmental pollutant) should be considered as a risk factor in the clinical history of patients as a possible inductor of BC metastasis.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Cytokines,Endocrine Disruptors,Phenols,bisphenol A",,"Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal,Breast Neoplasms,Drug Resistance, Neoplasm,Estradiol,Estrogen Receptor Modulators,Female,Fulvestrant,Humans"

32042059,-101,,,Association between urinary paraben concentrations and gestational weight gain during pregnancy.,"Parabens, a group of endocrine-disrupting chemicals, have been associated with obesity in previous studies. However, there is a paucity of literature regarding the effects of paraben exposures on gestational weight gain (GWG), a considerable predictor of obesity risk in both mothers and offspring later in life. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the associations between urinary paraben concentrations and GWG during the three trimesters of pregnancy. We collected urine samples from 613 pregnant women during the first, second, and third trimesters of their pregnancies between 2014 and 2015 in Wuhan, China. The urine concentrations of five parabens, including methylparaben (MeP), ethylparaben (EtP), propylparaben (PrP), butylparaben, and benzylparaben, were measured. Gestational weight in each trimester and prepregnancy weight were used to calculate trimester GWG. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate the trimester-specific and overall associations between paraben exposures and GWG rate (trimester GWG divided by the gestational week of the weight measurement, kg/week). We performed stratified analysis to further explore the potential effect modification by prepregnancy BMI. In the trimester-specific association analyses, the first-trimester concentrations MeP, EtP, PrP, and ‚àëparabens (sum of all five parabens's molar concentrations) were associated with an increased first-trimester GWG rate, and these associations were stronger than those of the second or third trimesters. The overall association analysis showed that increased trimester GWG rates were associated with the combined effects of exposure to MeP, PrP, or ‚àëparabens during all three trimesters. Stratified analysis showed that higher paraben exposures were associated with higher trimester GWG rates among overweight/obese women that among normal-weight or underweight women. Our results showed that paraben exposures were positively associated with trimester GWG rate during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester.

Mono(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (MEHP), the active metabolite of the widely used plasticizer DEHP, is known to disrupt Leydig steroidogenesis but its mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. We found that MEHP caused a significant reduction in hormone-induced steroid hormone production in two Leydig cell lines, MA-10 and MLTC-1. Consistent with disrupted cholesterol transport, we found that MEHP represses cAMP-induced  promoter activity. MEHP responsiveness was mapped to the proximal  promoter, which contains multiple binding sites for several transcription factors. In addition to STAR, we found that MEHP also reduced the levels of ferredoxin reductase, a protein essential for electron transport during steroidogenesis. Finally, we tested new plasticizers as alternatives to phthalates. Two plasticizers, dioctyl succinate and 1,6-hexanediol dibenzoate, had no significant effect on hormone-induced steroidogenesis.

One to two days after a single administration of ethane dimethanesulphonate to adult rats, guinea pigs, and hamsters, the Leydig cells showed marked ultrastructural alterations suggestive of degeneration and cell death. The former alterations included karyopyknosis, cytoplasmic vesiculation and accumulation of lipid inclusions and large lipofuscin bodies.

However, its underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. Here, we provide new evidence that BPA is a risk factor for T2D from a case-control study. To explore the detailed mechanisms, we used two types of diet models, standard diet (SD) and high-fat diet (HFD), to study the effects of long-term BPA exposure on prediabetes in 4-week-old mice. We found that BPA exposure for 12 weeks exacerbated HFD-induced prediabetic symptoms. Female mice showed increased body mass, serum insulin level, and impaired glucose tolerance, while male mice only exhibited impaired glucose tolerance. No change was found in SD-fed mice. Besides, BPA exposure enhanced astrocyte-dependent hypothalamic inflammation in both male and female mice, which impaired proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neuron functions. Moreover, eliminating inflammation by toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) knockout significantly abolished the effects of BPA on the hypothalamus and diet-induced prediabetes.

However, the molecular mechanisms of CCC-induced testosterone secretion disorders remain unclear. In this study, we found that CCC exposure above 20‚ÄâŒºg/mL inhibited the secretion of testosterone in Sprague-Dawley rats Leydig cells.

Western blot detection showed CCC exposure at 100, 200‚ÄâŒºg/mL increased the protein level of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GPR78), C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP), the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 D1 (UBE2D1) and the ring finger protein (RNF185) in the Leydig cells. The Leydig cells treated with 4-phenyl butyric acid (4-PBA), an ER stress inhibitor, rescued the testosterone secretion disorders and alleviated CCC-induced increase in the ER stress related protein levels at 200‚ÄâŒºg/mL CCC treatment.

Although DDT has been found to block androgen receptors, the effects of its low-dose exposure in different periods of ontogeny on the male reproductive system remain unclear. We evaluate sex steroid hormone production in the pubertal period and after maturation in male Wistar rats exposed to low doses of o,p'-DDT, either during prenatal and postnatal development or postnatal development alone. Prenatally and postnatally exposed rats exhibit lower testosterone production and increased estradiol and estriol serum levels after maturation, associated with the delayed growth of gonads. Postnatally exposed rats demonstrate accelerated growth of gonads and higher testosterone production in the pubertal period. In contrast to the previous group, they do not present raised estradiol production. All of the exposed animals exhibit a reduced conversion of progesterone to 17OH-progesterone after sexual maturation, which indicates putative attenuation of sex steroid production. Thus, the study reveals age-dependent outcomes of low-dose exposure to DDT. Prenatal onset of exposure results in the later onset of androgen production and the enhanced conversion of androgens to estrogens after puberty, while postnatal exposure induces the earlier onset of androgen secretion.","Androgens,Endocrine Disruptors,Estrogens,Gonadal Steroid Hormones,DDT","Aptasensor,E2,Fluorescent,Horseradish peroxidase,Hybridization chain reaction","Aptamers, Nucleotide,Biosensing Techniques,Estradiol,Horseradish Peroxidase,Humans,Limit of Detection,Nucleic Acid Hybridization"

Here, we test the hypothesis that PBDE effects on axonal morphogenesis are mediated by thyroid hormone and/or reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent mechanisms. Axonal growth and ROS were quantified in primary neuronal-glial co-cultures dissociated from neonatal rat hippocampi exposed to nM concentrations of BDE-47 or BDE-49 in the absence or presence of triiodothyronine (T3; 3-30 nM), N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC; 100 ¬µM), or Œ±-tocopherol (100 ¬µM). Co-exposure to T3 or either antioxidant prevented inhibition of axonal growth in hippocampal cultures exposed to BDE-47 or BDE-49. T3 supplementation in cultures not exposed to PBDEs did not alter axonal growth. T3 did, however, prevent PBDE-induced ROS generation and alterations in mitochondrial metabolism. Collectively, our data indicate that PBDEs inhibit axonal growth via ROS-dependent mechanisms, and that T3 protects axonal growth by inhibiting PBDE-induced ROS. These observations suggest that co-exposure to endocrine disruptors that decrease TH signaling in the brain may increase vulnerability to the adverse effects of developmental PBDE exposure on axonal morphogenesis.",,"17Œ≤-estradiol detection,Co/Ni-UiO-66,Modified carbon nanodots,Photoelectrochemical aptasensor,Ternary chalcogenides","Aptamers, Nucleotide,Electrodes,Endocrine Disruptors,Metal-Organic Frameworks,Phthalic Acids"
34986559,-100,,,Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside ameliorates cadmium induced uterine epithelium proliferation in mice.,"Cadmium (Cd) is an environmental pollutant and endocrine disrupter, abundantly present in water, food, and soil. Accumulation of Cd in the body can negatively affect female reproduction; especially the uterus is exceptionally sensitive to the toxic actions of Cd. The anthocyanin cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) is a naturally occurring phenolic compound in fruits and plants that can antagonize the toxic effects of Cd. This capacity makes C3G a possible candidate to prevent Cd-induced female infertility. The present study aimed to investigate: 1) whether C3G intake could prevent Cd-induced female reproductive toxicity, and 2) the underlying mechanisms responsible for this protective effect. The results of our study indicated that Cd exposure did not affect ovarian function, but induced hypertrophy of the uterine endometrium. Oral intake of C3G markedly reduced the effects of Cd exposure on the thickness of the uterine epithelium cells. Transcriptomic analysis of the endometrium revealed that C3G intake had anti-estrogenic effects, attenuating Cd-induced endometrial epithelial cell proliferation by inhibiting estrogen-responsive genes, enhancing epithelial progesterone receptor expression, and regulating Klf4 expression.

Previous studies have suggested that some per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) may alter serum vitamin D concentrations. However, no study has investigated the relationship between PFAS and vitamin D in pregnant women. This study aims to evaluate the associations of serum PFAS with serum total and free 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) during pregnancy in a cohort of African American women in Atlanta, GA. Blood samples from 442 participants were collected in early pregnancy (8-14 weeks of gestation) for PFAS and 25(OH)D measurements, and additional samples were collected in late pregnancy (24-30 weeks) for the second 25(OH)D measurements. We fit multivariable linear regressions and weighted quantile sum (WQS) regressions to estimate the associations of individual PFAS and their mixtures with 25(OH)D concentrations. We found mostly positive associations of total 25(OH)D with PFHxS (perfluorohexane sulfonic acid), PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonic acid), PFDA (perfluorodecanoic acid), and NMeFOSAA (N-methyl perfluorooctane sulfonamido acetic acid), and negative associations with PFPeA (perfluoropentanoic acid). For free 25(OH)D, positive associations were observed with PFHxS, PFOS, PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid), and PFDA, and a negative association with PFPeA among the women with male fetuses in the models using 25(OH)D measured in late pregnancy. In mixture models, a quartile increase in WQS index was associated with 2.88¬†ng/mL (95%CI 1.14-4.59) and 5.68¬†ng/mL (95%CI 3.31-8.04) increases in total 25(OH)D measured in the early and late pregnancy, respectively. NMeFOSAA, PFDA, and PFOS contributed the most to the overall effects among the eight PFAS. No association was found between free 25(OH)D and the PFAS mixture. These results suggest that PFAS may affect vitamin D biomarker concentrations in pregnant African American women, and some of the associations were modified by fetal sex.","Alkanesulfonic Acids,Biomarkers,Environmental Pollutants,Fluorocarbons,Vitamin D","Ecotoxicology,Endocrine disruptors,Multi-parameter risk assessment,Priority index,Surface water","Aquatic Organisms,Ecotoxicology,Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Monitoring,Risk Assessment"
25449418,-100,,,Effects of perfluorooctane sulfuric acid on placental PRL-family hormone production and fetal growth retardation in mice.,"Perfluorooctane sulfuric acid (PFOS) is a persistent organic pollutant, causes fetal growth retardation but the mechanism is still unclear. This study focused on PFOS-induced toxicity such as placental trophoblast cell histopathological changes, endocrine function (i.e., prolactin (PRL)-family hormone production) and subsequent fetal growth retardation in mice. Maternal body weight gain, placental and fetal weights were significantly decreased in proportion to PFOS dosage. Placental efficiency (fetal weight/placental weight) was significantly reduced dose-dependently. Necrotic changes were observed in PFOS-treated placental tissues, and the area of injury increased dose-dependently. Finally, mRNA levels and maternal serum concentrations of the PRL-family hormones (mPL-II, mPLP-CŒ±, mPLP-K) were significantly reduced dose-dependently. In addition, the changing pattern between PRL-family hormone concentrations and fetal body weight was positively correlated. These results suggest that gestational PFOS treatment induces placental histopathological changes and disruption of endocrine function, finally may lead to fetal growth retardation in mice.","Alkanesulfonic Acids,Fluorocarbons,Pit1 protein, mouse,Placental Hormones,Transcription Factor Pit-1,Prolactin,perfluorooctane sulfonic acid","Endocrine disrupting chemicals,HC(5),In silico models,Surface water,Toxicity threshold","Aquatic Organisms,Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship,Reproducibility of Results,Risk Assessment,Rivers,Species Specificity,Water Pollutants, Chemical"
35408676,-100,,,Bisphenol A Impairs Lipid Remodeling Accompanying Cell Differentiation in the Oligodendroglial Cell Line Oli-Neu.,"In the central nervous system, the process of myelination involves oligodendrocytes that wrap myelin around axons. Myelin sheaths are mainly composed of lipids and ensure efficient conduction of action potentials. Oligodendrocyte differentiation is an essential preliminary step to myelination which, in turn, is a key event of neurodevelopment. Bisphenol A (BPA), a ubiquitous endocrine disruptor, is suspected to disrupt this developmental process and may, thus, contribute to several neurodevelopmental disorders. In this study, we assessed the effect of BPA on oligodendrocyte differentiation through a comprehensive analysis of cell lipidome by UHPLC-HRMS. For this purpose, we exposed the oligodendroglial cell line Oli-neu to several BPA concentrations for 72 h of proliferation and another 72 h of differentiation. In unexposed cells, significant changes occurred in lipid distribution during Oli-neu differentiation, including an increase in characteristic myelin lipids, sulfatides, and ethanolamine plasmalogens, and a marked remodeling of phospholipid subclasses and fatty acid contents. Moreover, BPA induced a decrease in sulfatide and phosphatidylinositol plasmalogen contents and modified monounsaturated/polyunsaturated fatty acid relative contents in phospholipids. These effects counteracted the lipid remodeling accompanying differentiation and were confirmed by gene expression changes. Altogether, our results suggest that BPA disrupts lipid remodeling accompanying early oligodendrocyte differentiation.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Phenols,bisphenol A",,"Aqueous Humor,Endocrine System,Glaucoma,Glaucoma, Open-Angle,Humans,Intraocular Pressure,Optic Nerve"
3092989,-100,,,Acute lithium treatment suppresses the proestrous LH surge in mice: chronic lithium leads to constant diestrus.,"Although the therapeutic usefulness of lithium in manic-depressive psychosis is now well-established, a number of basic and clinical studies in recent years have shown that the administration of this anti-manic drug produces a wide range of adverse endocrine and metabolic effects. The present study was undertaken in order to examine (a) what effects acute lithium administration might have on the preovulatory surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) during proestrus, and (b) whether chronic lithium administration has any adverse effect on the estrous cycle in C57BL/6 mice. Acute injections of lithium on the day of proestrus (at 10.00, 16.00 and 18.00 h; LD 14:10; lights on at 05.00 h CST) at a dosage of 5 mEq/kg b. wt. led to a significant (P less than 0.01) suppression of the LH surge that normally occurs in the evening of proestrus at 21.00 h. Chronic administration of lithium, on the other hand, resulted in a complete disruption in the regularity of the estrous cycle. This was characterized by an increasing number of mice showing a continuous diestrous vaginal smear during the first week of exposure to lithium, after which all of the lithium-treated mice completely stopped cycling and entered into constant diestrus. These results represent for the first time that lithium has significant adverse effects on the reproductive function in the female, especially in regard to the proestrous LH surge and estrous cyclicity in mice. Since these adverse effects were manifested under conditions when plasma lithium concentrations were within or around the therapeutic range, our results provide important conceptual information concerning possible adverse effects of lithium on the reproductive function in the human female.","Luteinizing Hormone,Follicle Stimulating Hormone,Lithium","AtGSTF8,Bisphenol A,Molecular mechanism,Oxidative stress","Arabidopsis,Arabidopsis Proteins,Benzhydryl Compounds,Binding Sites,Glutathione Transferase,Molecular Docking Simulation,Oxidation-Reduction,Oxidative Stress,Phenols,Reactive Oxygen Species"

Our study examined the effects of lactational exposure to nondioxin-like PCB-155 and/or dioxin-like PCB-169 on longitudinal femur growth at the distal epiphyseal growth plate (EGP) in young rats at three different ages [postnatal days (PNDs) 9, 22, and 42]. After delivery, lactating rats were divided into four groups (PCB-169, PCB-155, PCB-155‚Äâ+‚Äâ169, and control) and administered PCBs intraperitoneally. The femurs of offspring were used to estimate growth rate (¬µm/day), and histomorphometric analysis on the distal femur included the thickness of the EGP and zones of proliferation and hypertrophy with calcification. Stereometry was used to determine trabecular bone volume density. In the PCB-169 and PCB-155‚Äâ+‚Äâ169 groups, PCB-169 affected longitudinal bone growth in the early postnatal period by interfering with chondrocytes in the EGP zone of proliferation and, to a lesser extent, the zone of hypertrophy. Morphometric alterations in EGP structure diminished until puberty. A slow growth rate persisted in the PCB-169 group until PND 42, while in the PCB-155 group, a fast growth rate between PNDs 9 to 22 was significantly reduced between PNDs 22 to 42. Sterometric assessment showed decreased trabecular bone volume in the PCB-155‚Äâ+‚Äâ169 group compared with that in the control on PND 9 and increased in the PCB-169 group compared with that in the PCB-155 group on PND 42. To summarize, studied PCB congeners exerted congener- and age-dependent effects on femur growth rate and its histomorphometric characteristics.","Polychlorinated Biphenyls,2,4,6,2',4',6'-hexachlorobiphenyl,3,4,5,3',4',5'-hexachlorobiphenyl",,"Arousal,Brain,Buprenorphine,Delayed-Action Preparations,Heroin,Heroin Dependence,Humans,Immunocompetence,Methadone,Motivation,Narcotics,Receptors, Opioid,Treatment Outcome"

Transient effect on spontaneous motor activity in rats following perinatal exposure to BDE-47 at low doses, relevant to human exposure, was reported in our previous study. The objective of this study was to screen for the long-term effects on gene expression in the brain of rats perinatally exposed to BDE-47. Wistar dams were exposed to BDE-47 (0.002 and 0.2 mg kg(-1) body weight) from gestation day 15 to postnatal day (PND) 20. Total RNA was extracted from the whole brain at PND10 and the brain frontal lobes at PND41 and hybridized to whole-genome RNA expression microarrays. The genes, differentially expressed 1.5-fold, were analyzed with the DAVID bioinformatics resources for cluster and gene-term enrichment. At PND41, clusters of genes involved in nerve impulse transmission, nervous system development and functioning, and core biosynthetic process were altered, including several downregulated genes of cation channels. Representation of LINE1 RNA was decreased significantly. Altered expression of genes involved in neurodevelopment occured at least 3 weeks after the last exposure and the behavioral manifestation of low dose BDE-47 toxicity.","Flame Retardants,Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers,Polybrominated Biphenyls,2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether","Emerging contaminants,Epidemiology,Public health,Water scarcity,Water sustainability","Arsenic,China,Climate Change,Cosmetics,Drinking Water,Endocrine Disruptors,Fluorides,Humans,Sustainable Development,Urbanization,Water Pollutants, Chemical,Water Pollution,Water Supply"
32272586,-100,,,Developmental Exposure to the Flame Retardant Mixture Firemaster 550 Compromises Adult Bone Integrity in Male but not Female Rats.,"Flame retardants (FRs) are used in a variety of common items from furniture to carpet to electronics to reduce flammability and combustion, but the potential toxicity of these compounds is raising health concerns globally. Organophosphate FRs (OPFRs) are becoming more prevalent as older, brominated FRs are phased out, but the toxicity of these compounds, and the FR mixtures that contain them, is poorly understood. Work in a variety of in vitro model systems has suggested that FRs may induce metabolic reprogramming such that bone density is compromised at the expense of increasing adiposity. To address this hypothesis, the present studies maternally exposed Wistar rat dams orally across gestation and lactation to 1000 ¬µg daily of the FR mixture Firemaster 550 (FM 550) which contains a mixture of brominated FRs and OPFRs. At six months of age, the offspring of both sexes were examined for evidence of compromised bone composition. Bone density, composition, and marrow were all significantly affected, but only in males. The fact that the phenotype was observed months after exposure suggests that FM 550 altered some fundamental aspect of mesenchymal stem cell reprogramming. The severity of the phenotype and the human-relevance of the dose employed, affirm this is an adverse outcome meriting further exploration.","Dust,Firemaster 550,Flame Retardants,Organophosphates,Polybrominated Biphenyls","arsenic,epidemiological studies,thyroid function,thyroid hormones","Arsenic,Environmental Exposure,Humans,Thyroid Gland,Thyrotropin,Thyroxine,Triiodothyronine"
34746152,-100,,,Coiled-Coil Domain Containing 80 Suppresses Nonylphenol-Induced Colorectal Cancer Cell Proliferation by Inhibiting the Activation of ERK1/2.,"Recently, the effect of endocrine-disrupting chemicals on the cancer procession has been a concern. Nonylphenol (NP) is a common environmental estrogen that has been shown to enhance the proliferation of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells in our previous studies; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we confirmed the increased concentration of NP in the serum of patients with CRC. RNA sequencing was used to explore the differentially expressed genes after NP exposure. We found 16 upregulated genes and 12 downregulated genes in COLO205 cells after NP treatment. Among these differentially expressed genes, we found that coiled-coil domain containing 80 (CCDC80) was downregulated by NP treatment and was associated with CRC progression. Further experiments revealed that the overexpression of CCDC80 significantly suppressed NP-induced cell proliferation and recovered the reduced cell apoptosis. Meanwhile, the overexpression of CCDC80 significantly inhibited the activation of ERK1/2 induced by NP treatment. ERK1/2 inhibitor (PD98059) treatment also suppressed NP-induced CRC cell growth, but the overexpression of CCDC80 did not enhance the effect of ERK1/2 inhibitor. Taken together, NP treatment significantly inhibited the expression of CCDC80, and the overexpression of CCDC80 suppressed NP-induced CRC cell growth by inhibiting the activation of ERK1/2. These results suggest that NP could induce CRC cell growth by influencing the expression of multiple genes. CCDC80 and ERK1/2 inhibitors may be suitable therapeutic targets in NP-related CRC progression.",,,"Arthritis, Rheumatoid,Central Nervous System,Fibromyalgia,Humans,Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic,Nervous System Diseases,Nociceptors,Pain"

35561261,-99,,,Bisphenol S favors hepatic steatosis development via an upregulation of liver MCT1 expression and an impairment of the mitochondrial respiratory system.,"Bisphenol S (BPS) is a common substitute of bisphenol A (BPA). Recent data suggest that BPS acts as an obesogenic endocrine disruptor with emerging implications in the physiopathology of metabolic syndrome. However, the effects of BPS on monocarboxylate transporters (acting as carriers for lactate, pyruvate, and ketone bodies) and the mitochondrial respiratory system in the liver remain limited. For this purpose, male Swiss mice were treated with BPS at 100‚Äâ¬µg/kg/day for 10 weeks, in drinking water. An increase in body weight and food intake was observed with no increase in locomotor activity. Moreover, data show that BPS increases hepatic MCT1 (a key energetic fuel transporter) mRNA expression accompanied by hepatic steatosis initiation and lipid accumulation, while disrupting mitochondrial function and oxidative stress parameters. Furthermore, BPS produced a significant increase in lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase activities. We can suggest that BPS contributes to hepatic steatosis in mice by upregulating monocarboxylate transporters and affecting the bioenergetic status characterized by an impaired mitochondrial respiratory system. Thus, our data highlight a new mechanism putatively implicated in hepatic steatosis development during BPS-induced obesity involving lactate metabolism.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Lactates",,"Astrocytoma,Calcium,Cell Line, Tumor,Cell Movement,Central Nervous System,Ghrelin,Humans,Models, Biological,Peptide Hormones,Peptides,RNA Interference,Receptors, Cell Surface,Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled,Receptors, Ghrelin"

The present research set out to investigate the possible reproductive toxicity of acrylamide. The research was also expanded to explore the protective effects of two nutraceuticals, thymoquinone (TQ) and capsaicin, against acrylamide-induced reproductive toxicity. Six groups of sixty male albino rats were created. Group 1 was used as a control. Rats were administered a daily dose of acrylamide and acted as the model in Group 2. TQ was provided to rats once a day in Group 3. Capsaicin was administered to rats once a day in Group 4. TQ was given once daily to rats exposed to acrylamide in Group 5. Rats were given capsaicin once a day for eight weeks after being exposed to acrylamide in Group 6. Acrylamide induced oxidative stress, testicular NF-Œ∫B/p65 expression, and down-regulated the expression of occludin, all of which can contribute to its testicular toxicity, while TQ or capsaicin removes all of these toxicity signs. TQ and capsaicin have shown efficacy in alleviating all of the acrylamide's toxic insults in the current reproductive toxicity model.

We first monitored the nuclear fragmentation in Leydig cells after exposure to styrene or styrene-7,8-oxide. Hoechst 33258 cell staining showed that styrene exposure in TM3 Leydig cells did not exhibit nuclear fragmentation at any concentration.

The molecular-level mechanisms of BPA action are not known in detail, which calls for systematic investigations using cell membrane models. This paper shows that BPA affects Langmuir monolayers and giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) used as membrane models, in a concentration-dependent manner and with effects that depend on BPA aggregation. BPA increases DPPC monolayer fluidity in surface pressure isotherms upon interacting with the headgroups through hydrogen bonding, according to polarization-modulated infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS). In DPPC GUVs, BPA induced wrinkling and distortion in the spherical shape of the vesicles, but this was only observed for fresh solutions where it is not aggregated. BPA also decreased the viability of hamster ovary cells (CHO) in in vitro experiments. In contrast, aged, aggregated BPA solutions did not affect the GUVs and even increased CHO viability. These results may be rationalized in terms of size-dependent effects of BPA, which may be relevant for its endocrine-disrupting effects.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Phenols,bisphenol A","autism spectrum disorder,developmental neurotoxicants,endocrine disrupting chemicals,prenatal exposure","Autism Spectrum Disorder,Endocrine Disruptors,Female,Humans,Pregnancy,Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects,Risk Factors,Stereotyped Behavior"

The aim of this study was to examine the relationship of BPA and its naturally occurring metabolite BPA-glucuronide (BPA-g) with sex steroid hormone levels in South African mother-child pairs. Third-trimester serum maternal samples and matching cord blood samples were analyzed for BPA, BPA-g and nine sex steroid hormones using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Sixty maternal and child pairs were analyzed. Rank correlation demonstrated a significant positive relationship between cord blood estradiol and cord blood BPA (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.002) and maternal BPA levels (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.02) respectively. Cord blood testosterone from male infants showed a negative Spearman's correlation (r=-0.5, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.02) with maternal BPA-g. There was no statistical difference in total testosterone levels in cord blood from male and female infants. The findings of the current study indicate a significant relationship between some key sex steroid hormones namely testosterone, dihydrotestosterone and estradiol and fetal exposure BPA.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Glucuronides,Gonadal Steroid Hormones,Phenols,bisphenol A glucuronide,Dihydrotestosterone,Testosterone,Estradiol,bisphenol A",,"Autoimmune Diseases,Autoimmunity,B-Lymphocytes,Female,Humans,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Complications,T-Lymphocytes,Thyroid Diseases,Thyroid Gland,Thyroiditis, Autoimmune"

33730294,-99,,,Endocrine disrupting potency and toxicity of novel sophorolipid quaternary ammonium salts.,"A new class of biosurfactants, namely quaternary ammonium sophorolipids (SQAS), suitable for pharmaceutical applications, was tested for the evaluation of their (anti)estrogenic and (anti)androgenic potency with the help of YES/YAS assays. Also their toxicity towards yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and bacteria (Escherichia coli) was checked. The results achieved for SQAS, which can be regarded as potential micropollutants, were compared with those obtained for two well-known micropollutants diclofenac and 17Œ±-ethinylestradiol subjected to the same testing procedures. This work demonstrated that acetylation of the hydroxyl group of the carbohydrate head of SQAS decreased the toxicity of this class of biosurfactants towards Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Furthermore, it contributed to the decrease of their endocrine disrupting potency. None of the SQAS studied showed clear agonist activity for female or male hormones. SQAS1 and SQAS2 revealed weak antiestrogenic and antiandrogenic potency. All of these properties were weaker, not only to the potency of the appropriate positive control in the antagonists bioassays, but also compared to the potency of other tested compounds, i.e. DCF and EE2. SQAS3 possessed most probably inhibitory activity towards male hormones. Moreover, cytotoxicity of two out of four studied SQAS at the highest concentrations towards the strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae interfered with the endocrine disruption activity. It would be also worth studying it with the use of another endocrine activity test.","Ammonium Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Oleic Acids,Salts,sophorolipid,Ethinyl Estradiol","Uhthoff's phenomenon,autonomic dysfunction,demyelination,heat intolerance,skin blood flow,sudomotor,sweating","Autonomic Nervous System Diseases,Body Temperature Regulation,Fever,Humans,Hypothermia,Multiple Sclerosis"

However, there is a lack of comprehensive data on the BPA-induced disruption of the association and functional characteristics of the testicular germ cells, which the present study sought to investigate. Adult male mice were administered BPA doses by gavage for six consecutive weeks and allowed to breed, producing generations F1-F4. Testis samples from each generation were evaluated for several parameters, including abnormal structure, alterations in germ cell proportions, apoptosis, and loss of functional properties of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). We observed that at the lowest-observed-adverse-effect level (LOAEL) dose, the testicular abnormalities and alterations in seminiferous epithelium staging persisted in F0-F2 generations, although a reduced total spermatogonia count was found only in F0. However, abnormalities in the proportions of germ cells were observed until F2. Exposure of the male mice (F0) to BPA alters the morphology of the testis along with the association of germ cells and stemness properties of SSCs, with the effects persisting up to F2. Therefore, we conclude that BPA induces physiological and functional disruption in male germ cells, which may lead to reproductive health issues in the next generation.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Phenols,bisphenol A",,"Autonomic Nervous System,Body Temperature Regulation,Central Nervous System,Heat Exhaustion,Hemodynamics,Humans,Multiple Sclerosis,Regional Blood Flow,Skin,Sweating,Thermosensing"
31991346,-99,,,Multidisciplinary approach to determine the effect of polybrominated diphenyl ethers on gut microbiota.,"Environmental health is increasingly compromised by persistent toxic substances, which may have serious implications in food safety and, thus, in human health. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are anthropogenic contaminants with endocrine disruption abilities and are commonly found in seafood, the main route of human exposure. Growing evidence points out that the human gut microbiota interacts with xenobiotics, which may lead to impairment of host homeostasis if functions of microbiota become compromised. The aim of this study was to ascertain if the physiological balance of human gut microbiome is affected by the presence and degree of exposure to PBDEs. Fermentation was performed in a batch closed-system using an inoculum made from fresh human stool. The volatolomic profile was analysed by solid-phase microextraction coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Mesophilic, Gram-negative bacteria and coliforms were quantified by classic plating methods. Changes in the gut microbiome were evaluated after DNA extraction followed by deep sequencing of the 16S rDNA region. The exposure to PBDEs resulted in an imbalance in sulfur, short-chain fatty acids and aromatic organic compounds, changing the microbial volatolome in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Slight deviations in the microbial structure of human gut occurred in the presence of PBDEs, especially for high doses of exposure. For the first time, the impact of PBDEs on the microbial homeostasis of human gut microbiota was taken into consideration, revealing noteworthy modifications with serious health implications even at oral exposure doses considered as safe by worldwide regulatory entities.","Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers,Xenobiotics","cross-talk,endocrine system,gut microbiome,human microbiome","Bacteria,Bacterial Physiological Phenomena,Endocrine System,Gastrointestinal Tract,Humans,Metagenome"

35174924,-99,,,The potential implications of estrogenic and antioxidant-dependent activities of high doses of methyl paraben on MCF7 breast cancer cells.,"Methyl paraben (MP) is an endocrine-disrupting compound that possesses estrogenic properties and contributes to an aberrant burden of estrogen signaling in the human breast and subsequently increasing the risks for the development of breast cancer. The exact exposure, as well as the safe concentrations, are variable among daily products. The present study addresses the effects of exposure to escalated concentrations of MP on the proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells in addition to exploring its other mechanisms of action. The study involved exposure of cultured MCF-7 breast cancer cells to seven MP concentrations, ranging from 40 to 800‚Äâ¬µM for 5 days. Cell viability, apoptosis, and proliferation were respectively assessed using crystal violet test, flow cytometric analysis, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for Ki-67 expression. The estradiol (E2) secretion and oxidative stress were also assessed and analyzed in correlation to MP's proliferation and cytotoxicity potentials. The results showed that the maximum proliferative concentration of MP was 800‚Äâ¬µM. At a concentration of 40‚ÄâŒºM and higher, MP induced increased expression of Ki-67, denoting enhanced proliferation of the cells in monolayer culture. A positive correlation between the detrimental oxidative stress effect of MP's tested concentrations, cell proliferation, and viability was demonstrated (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05). Our results indicated that MP at high doses induced sustained cell proliferation due to E2 secretion as well as its antioxidant activity. Accordingly, it was concluded that high and unpredicted exposure to MP might carry a carcinogenic hazard on estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells.","Antioxidants,Estrogens,Ki-67 Antigen,Parabens,Estradiol","17Œ≤-estradiol catabolism,Caenibius tardaugens,Escherichia coli,TetR regulator,estrogen,estrogen biosensor,estrogen metabolism,transcriptional regulation","Bacterial Proteins,Biosensing Techniques,Estradiol,Estrogens,Estrone,Promoter Regions, Genetic,Sphingomonadaceae"

Urinary sex hormone excretion has emerged as a complementary strategy to evaluate gonadal function. Herein, we determined the associations between environmental exposure to arsenic and urinary sex hormone elimination and in vitro Leydig cell steroidogenesis. Concentrations of arsenic and testosterone (T), estradiol (E) and progesterone (P) in repeated urine samples were determined among 451 reproductive-age males. Moreover, an in vitro Leydig cell MLTC-1 steroidogenesis experiment was designed to simulate real-world scenarios of low human exposure. Multivariable linear regression models were used to assess the associations of urinary arsenic levels with urinary hormones. Urinary arsenic concentrations were positively associated with urinary sex hormone (T, E, and P) levels. An in vitro test further demonstrated that a population-based environmental exposure range (0.01-5\xa0ŒºM) of arsenic induced Leydig cell steroidogenesis potency.

Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to lead: (1) from gestational d 5 through birth; (2) during pregnancy and lactation; (3) during lactation only; (4) from birth through adulthood; or (5) from gestational d 5 through adulthood. Lead effects were measured on the development of aspects of the reproductive system, adult sex steroid levels, and growth rates in both male and female animals. The relative weights of male secondary sex organs in adult offspring were not significantly affected in any of the lead-treated groups. In contrast, female pups exposed to lead from birth through adulthood or from gestational day 5 through adulthood were observed to have significantly delayed vaginal opening and disrupted estrus cycling. These effects on female reproductive physiology were not observed in animals where lead exposure was confined only to pregnancy or lactation. Significant suppression of adult mean serum testosterone levels was only observed in male pups exposed to lead continuously from gestational age 5 d throughout life. Lead decreased birth weight in all animals exposed in utero and mean body weights were significantly decreased in all lead-treated groups up to weaning. Analysis of growth curves revealed that all lead-treated groups had significantly reduced growth rates during lactation. However, in addition, in male pups exposed to lead during pregnancy and lactation, from birth or from gestational age 5 d, growth rates were also significantly reduced during puberty. Postpubertal growth rates were unaffected in any lead-treated group. Thus, delayed female reproductive development and suppression of adult male serum testosterone concentration required continuous exposure to the heavy metal. Little evidence was observed for an alteration of ""endocrine imprinting"" by lead on either reproductive or growth parameters. Exposure during early development (pregnancy and lactation) resulted in no permanent effects in this model other than small (10%) decreases in the body weight of pups postpuberty.","Androgens,Lead,Growth Hormone",,"Base Sequence,Chromosomes, Human, X,Female,Humans,Male,Mental Retardation, X-Linked,Molecular Sequence Data,Nuclear Proteins,Pedigree,Sequence Deletion,Transcription Factors"

However, the relationships between OPs exposure and thyroid hormone levels in the general population are unclear. This study aimed to explore the relationships of OPs exposure with thyroid hormone and antibody levels in the general population. We analyzed a sample of 1089 US adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001-2002. OPs exposure was estimated using measures of six non-specific dialkyl phosphate metabolites (DAPs), e.g., dimethylphosphate (DMP). Multiple linear regression models were used to examine the associations of OPs exposure with thyroid hormone and antibody levels. The medians of urinary ‚àëDAPs detected in males and females were 32.98¬†nmol/g creatinine and 40.77¬†nmol/g creatinine, with statistical significance (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.001). After controlling for sociodemographic factors, we found that concentrations of urinary OPs metabolites were positively associated with the serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in the general US population, particularly in males; OPs metabolites were associated with the serum TgAb, tT3, fT3, and TSH. These findings showed that thyroid hormone and antibody disruption are probably associated with OPs exposure in the general population; more studies are needed to confirm our findings.","Organophosphates,Creatinine,Thyroid Hormones,Thyrotropin,Insecticides,Phosphates",,"Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors,Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors,Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung,Cell Line, Tumor,Cell Proliferation,DNA Helicases,Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic,Genes, myc,Humans,Lung Neoplasms,Mutation,Nuclear Proteins,Promoter Regions, Genetic,Small Cell Lung Carcinoma,Transcription Factors"

We aimed to examine maternal urinary paraben concentrations and their neonates' outcome indexes. Methylparaben (MP), ethylparaben (EP), propylparaben (PP), and butylparaben (BP) concentrations were measured in 105 maternal urine samples collected before delivery. Length, weight, and head circumference at birth were extracted from the mothers' delivery files. A multivariable linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association between paraben levels and neonatal anthropometric indices. The median levels of urinary parabens, especially BP, were higher than those in other countries. Prenatal urinary concentration of MP and BP showed a significantly positive association with birth weight in all neonates (Œ≤ = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.16, 1.41, and Œ≤ = 8.56, 95% CI: 3.95, 13.17, respectively), while these chemicals showed a significant negative association with head circumference (Œ≤ = - 0.002, 95% CI: - 0.004, - 0.000, and Œ≤ = - 0.016, 95% CI: - 0.030, - 0.002, respectively).

34287714,-99,,,Impairment of caprine oocyte maturation in vitro and alteration of granulosa cells functions by widely used fungicide mancozeb.,"Mancozeb is classified as an endocrine disruptor; thus the present study was carried out to investigate the impact of mancozeb on mammalian ovarian functions using in vitro caprine oocyte maturation and granulosa cell culture models. Caprine cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) and granulosa cells were cultured under standard culture conditions and treated with mancozeb concentrations of 0.3, 3, and 30¬†Œºg/ml along with a control for 24¬†h and assessed. Granulosa cell viability and progesterone concentration in spent culture media after treatments were also assessed. Mancozeb significantly decreased (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05) the oocytes cumulus expansion and the maturation of caprine oocytes. Marked changes in granulose cell morphology were observed with 30¬†Œºg/ml mancozeb and significantly reduced (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05) cell viability. Interestingly, the same concentrations significantly increased (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05) the progesterone secretion by the cells. Significant reduction of granulosa cells viability and reduction of cumulus expansion and suppression of metaphase plate formation in oocyte can impair the fertilization ability and developmental potential of the oocytes. High progesterone concentration due to mancozeb treatment may suppress LH surge and suppress ovulation. In conclusion, mancozeb suppresses granulosa cells viability, reduces cumulus expansion, and suppresses metaphase plate formation but induces progesterone secretion from granulosa cells that may inhibit LH surge for ovulation process.","Fungicides, Industrial,Maneb,mancozeb,Zineb","Bayesian kernel machine regression,birth outcome,birth weight,bisphenol,mixtures analyses","Bayes Theorem,Benzhydryl Compounds,Cohort Studies,Endocrine Disruptors,Female,Humans,Phenols,Pregnancy,Prospective Studies"
34781130,-99,,,Prenatal exposure to bisphenols and risk of preterm birth: Findings from Guangxi Zhuang birth cohort in China.,"Preterm birth (PTB), a serious adverse birth outcome, is the leading cause of perinatal mortality and morbidity. Bisphenols induce endocrine disruption that spreads across the placenta, which may affect fetal growth and development. However, the effects of bisphenols on PTB, particularly their combined effects, remain unknown. This study investigated the association between prenatal bisphenol exposure and PTB. Study participants were 2023 mother-infant pairs that were selected from the Guangxi Zhuang Birth Cohort. Maternal serum bisphenol levels were measured using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and pregnancy outcomes were obtained from medical records. Multivariate logistic regression, restricted cubic spline, principal component analysis (PCA), quantile g-computation (Qgcomp), and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) were used to examine the association between serum bisphenol levels and PTB. Ln-transformed BPA concentrations were associated with an increased risk of PTB only in female infants (OR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.64). Ln-transformed bisphenol F (BPF) concentrations were positively associated with the risk of PTB (OR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.18, 2.55). Inverse U-shaped relationships were observed between bisphenol B (BPB), bisphenol S (BPS), and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) levels and the risk of PTB (P-overall < 0.05, P-non-linear < 0.05). After sex stratification, the association between BPA analogs and PTB was only observed in males. In Qgcomp analysis, bisphenol mixtures were related to an increased¬†risk of PTB (OR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.04, 2.21), with BPF (43.7%), BPS (29.6%) and BPA (26.8%) having the greatest positive contribution. Results indicate that prenatal exposure to bisphenol mixtures might increase the risk of PTB, which might be primarily driven by BPA, BPF and BPS.

The mechanism of BPA exposure in hepatic lipid accumulation and its potential effect on NAFLD remain unclear. This study investigated the effect of BPA-exposure-induced hepatic lipid deposition on the pathology of NAFLD and its underlying mechanism in vitro and in vivo. BPA increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and promoted fatty acid uptake through upregulation of a free fatty acid uptake transporter, cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), in HUH-7 cells. Additionally, C57BL/6 mice administered a high-fat/high-cholesterol/high-cholic acid diet (HFCCD) and BPA (50 mg/kg body weight) for 8 weeks developed a steatohepatitis-like phenotype, characterized by alpha-smooth muscle actin (Œ±-SMA, an indicator of hepatic fibrosis) and cleaved caspase 3 (an indicator of apoptosis) in hepatic tissue; moreover, they had a higher oxidative stress index of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in liver tissue compared to the control group. Treatment with ROS scavenger n-acetylcysteine (NAC) ameliorated BPA-mediated HFCCD-induced lipid accumulation and steatohepatitis in the livers of treated mice.

At the pups' weaning, we sacrificed the dams and analyzed the oxytocin system, involved in the control of the maternal care, in the hypothalamic magnocellular nuclei. At birth, pups from BPA-treated dams tended to have lower male-to-female ratio compared to controls, while the opposite was observed among BPS litters. During the first postnatal week, offspring mortality impacted differentially BPA and BPS litters, with more female dead pups among the BPA litters, while more male dead pups in the BPS litters, sharpening the difference in the sex ratio. BPA and BPS dams spent significantly less time in pup-related behaviors than controls. Oxytocin-ir in paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei was increased only in the BPA-treated dams. Alterations in maternal care, along with the treatment itself, may affect, later in life, the offspring physiology and behavior. The exposure to BPs during sensitive developmental periods represents a risk for both dams and offspring, even at low environmentally-relevant doses, through the functional alteration of neural circuits controlling fundamental behaviors for pup survival, such as maternal behaviors.",,,"Bayes Theorem,Child,Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Pollutants,Female,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Longitudinal Studies,Maternal Exposure,Pregnancy,Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects,United Kingdom"
36084878,-99,,,Effects of endocrine active contaminating pesticides on RACK1 expression and immunological consequences in THP-1 cells.,"We have previously demonstrated that RACK1, which expression is under steroid hormone control, plays an important role in the activation of immune cells and its expression can be useful to evaluate the immunotoxic profile of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Hence, we investigated the effects of three contaminating and persistent pesticides: the fungicide vinclozolin (VIN), the herbicide atrazine (ATR) and the insecticide cypermethrin (CYP) on RACK1 expression and on innate immune response. VIN resulted in modest alteration of RACK1 while ATR and CYP reduced in a dose dependent manner RACK1 expression, ultimately leading to the decrease in lipopolysaccharide-induced IL-8 and TNF-Œ± release and CD86 and CD54 surface marker expression. Moreover, our data indicate that, after exposure to EDCs, alterations of RACK1 expression can also occur with mechanisms not directly mediated by an interaction with a nuclear or membrane steroid receptors. Therefore, RACK1 could represent a useful EDCs screening tool to evaluate their immunotoxic potential and to dissect their mechanisms of action.","Endocrine Disruptors,Fungicides, Industrial,Herbicides,Hormones,Insecticides,Interleukin-8,Lipopolysaccharides,Neoplasm Proteins,Pesticides,RACK1 protein, human,Receptors for Activated C Kinase,Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha,Atrazine","Essential elements,Pregnancy,Thyroid stimulating hormone,Thyroxine,Toxic metals,Triiodothyronine","Bayes Theorem,Child,Female,Humans,Iodine,Pregnancy,Selenium,Thyroid Hormones,Thyrotropin,Thyroxine,Triiodothyronine"
31931345,-99,,,Onset and tempo of sexual maturation is differentially associated with gestational phthalate exposure between boys and girls in a Mexico City birth cohort.,"Phthalates are endocrine disrupting compounds commonly found in consumer products, exposure to which may influence reproductive maturation. Effects from exposure in utero on the onset and progression of sexual development are understudied. We examined longitudinal associations between gestational phthalate exposure and sexual maturation at two points in adolescence (8-14, 9-18¬†years). Gestational exposure was quantified using the geometric mean of 3 trimester-specific urinary phthalate metabolite measurements. Sexual maturation was assessed using Tanner stages and menarche onset for girls and Tanner stages and testicular volume for boys. Generalized estimating equations for correlated ordinal multinomial responses were used to model relationships between phthalates and odds of transitioning to the next Tanner stage, while generalized additive (GA) mixed models were used to assess the odds of menarche. All models were adjusted for child age (centered around the mean), BMI z-score, change in BMI between visits, time (years) between visits (ŒîT), and interactions between ŒîT and mean-centered child age and the natural log of exposure metabolite concentration. Among girls, a doubling of gestational MBzP concentrations was associated with increased odds of being at a higher Tanner stage for breast development at 8-14¬†years (OR¬†=¬†4.62; 95% CI: 1.38, 15.5), but with slower progression of breast development over the follow-up period (OR¬†=¬†0.65 per year; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.92) after adjustment for child age and BMI z-score. Similar results were found for ‚àëDEHP levels and breast development. In boys, a doubling of gestational MBP concentrations was associated with lower odds of being at a higher Tanner stage for pubic hair growth at 8-14¬†years (OR¬†=¬†0.37; 95% CI: 0.14, 0.95) but with faster progression (OR: 1.28; 95% CI: 0.97, 1.69). These results indicate that gestational phthalate exposures may impact the onset and progression of sexual development, and that these relationships differ between boys and girls.","Phenols,Phthalic Acids,phthalic acid","Bisphenol A,Contaminants of emerging concern,Endocrine disrupting chemicals,Estuarine monitoring,Flame retardants,Plastic additives","Bays,China,Ecosystem,Environmental Monitoring,Esters,Flame Retardants,Organophosphates,Risk Assessment,San Francisco"
11771925,-99,,,Nitromusk compounds in women with gynecological and endocrine dysfunction.,"Musk xylene (MX), musk ketone (MK), musk ambrette, musk moskene, and musk tibetene are synthetic fragrances. Between 1994 and 1996 these five nitromusk compounds (NMCs) were tested in the blood of 152 women who consulted the Endocrinological Department of the University Hospital of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Heidelberg, Germany, because of gynecological problems. The testing was conducted by gas chromotography with mass-specific detector and mass spectrometry in a retrospective cross-sectional study. MX was detected in 95% and MK in 85% of the blood samples (>20 ng per liter whole blood). The median concentration of MX was 65.5 ng/L and the maximum level of MX was 1183 ng/L; the corresponding values for MK were respectively 55.5 and 518 ng/L. The other three NMCs were found in only a few patients or not at all. Significant associations between MX and MK concentrations were found in blood and different clinical parameters of the endocrine system. MX and MK may act centrally as a disrupter of the (supra-) hypothalamic-ovarian axis, which may result in a mild ovarian insufficiency. On the basis of our data, a reproductive toxicity and an endocrine effect of NMCs in women cannot be ruled out. Further experimental and clinical studies should be conducted.","Dinitrobenzenes,Indans,Mutagens,Perfume,Xylenes,musk tibetine,moskene,musk xylene,musk ketone,musk ambrette (artificial),Luteinizing Hormone","ecological risk assessment,environmental organic pollutants,polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,remote coastal marine areas","Bays,China,Environmental Monitoring,Japan,Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons,Risk Assessment,Rivers,Water,Water Pollutants, Chemical"

33049508,-98,,,Tebuconazole exposure disrupts placental function and causes fetal low birth weight in rats.,"Tebuconazole (TEB) is one of the widely used broad-spectrum triazole fungicides. Its accumulation in mammals leads to various endocrine disruptions. However, it is unclear whether the exposure of TEB during pregnancy affects the growth and development of fetus and placenta. Here, TEB was exposed to pregnant Sprague-Dawley female rats from gestational days 12-21 of 0, 25, 50 or 100¬†mg/kg for 10 days. TEB reduced placental estradiol levels. TEB disrupted the structure and function of the placenta, leading to hypertrophy, fibrin exudation, edema, calcification, arterial fibroblast proliferation, and trophoblastic infarction. RNA-seq analysis showed that TEB mainly down-regulated the expression of iron transport genes and up-regulated the expression of genes for immune/inflammatory responses. Further qPCR showed that TEB down-regulated Tfrc, Hamp, Eif2ak2 and up-regulated the expression of Cd34, Cd36, Jag1, Pln, Cyp1a1, Esrra, and Aqp1 at 50 and 100¬†mg/kg. Western blot and semi-quantitative immunohistochemical staining also demonstrated that TEB lowered the levels of TFRC and EIF2AK2 and increased the levels of CD34, CD36, JAG1, CYP1A1, and ESRRA at 50 and 100¬†mg/kg. In conclusion, TEB severely damages the structure and function of the placenta, leading to hypertrophy of the placenta, low birth weight and feminization of the male fetus possibly via several pathways including iron transport and TNF signaling.","Triazoles,tebuconazole","Environmental,female,fertility,lifestyle factors,metals,miscarriage,occupational,oxidative stress,pregnancy - reproductive impairment","Benzene,DNA Methylation,Environmental Exposure,Female,Humans,Infertility, Male,Male,Metals,Occupational Exposure,Oxidative Stress,Pesticides,Pregnancy,Reproduction"
33431410,-98,,,Bisphenol A promotes stress granule assembly and modulates the integrated stress response.,"Bisphenol-A (BPA) is a ubiquitous precursor of polycarbonate plastics that is found in the blood and serum of >92% of Americans. While BPA has been well documented to act as a weak estrogen receptor (ER) agonist, its effects on cellular stress are unclear. Here, we demonstrate that high-dose BPA causes stress granules (SGs) in human cells. A common estrogen derivative, Œ≤-estradiol, does not trigger SGs, indicating the mechanism of SG induction is not via the ER pathway. We also tested other structurally related environmental contaminants including the common BPA substitutes BPS and BPF, the industrial chemical 4-nonylphenol (4-NP) and structurally related compounds 4-EP and 4-VP, as well as the pesticide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). The variable results from these related compounds suggest that structural homology is not a reliable predictor of the capacity of a compound to cause SGs. Also, we demonstrate that BPA acts primarily through the PERK pathway to generate canonical SGs. Finally, we show that chronic exposure to a low physiologically relevant dose of BPA suppresses SG assembly upon subsequent acute stress. Interestingly, this SG inhibition does not affect phosphorylation of eIF2Œ± or translation inhibition, thus uncoupling the physical assembly of SGs from translational control. Our work identifies additional effects of BPA beyond endocrine disruption that may have consequences for human health.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2,Phenols,PERK kinase,eIF-2 Kinase,bisphenol A","Biomonitoring,Consumer products,Educational intervention,Endocrine disrupting chemicals,Environmental health literacy,Exposure reduction","Benzhydryl Compounds,Benzophenones,Biological Monitoring,Consumer Behavior,Crowdsourcing,Humans,Parabens,Phenols,Triclosan"
33304177,-98,,,Developmental exposure to endocrine disrupter dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane alters transcriptional regulation of postnatal morphogenesis of adrenal zona fasciculata.,"The present study is aimed to validate expression of transcriptional factors mediating postnatal development of adrenal zona fasciculata in rats exposed to low doses of endocrine disrupter dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane prenatally and postnatally. Histological and immunohistochemical examination of the adrenals was performed. Impaired blood circulation, dystrophy and cell death were found in zona fasciculata of pubertal rats after developmental exposure to low doses of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane. Reparation of zona fasciculata was associated with increased number of Sonic hedgehog- and Oct4-expressing adrenal cortical cells but not in areas of regeneration. These data suggest that cell death may promote upregulation of factors inducing and maintaining pluripotent state in fasciculata cells for restoration of tissue homeostasis. Termination of growth of the adrenals after puberty was associated with upregulation of antiproliferative factor Hhex and decrease of cell proliferation. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane exposure disrupted transcriptional control of cell proliferation by downregulation of Hhex expression in fasciculata cells. Decrease of proliferation in the exposed rats was mediated by inhibition of Sonic hedgehog and Oct4 expression and suppression of canonical Wnt signaling. The present study elucidated an alternative mechanism of proliferation control activated by endocrine disrupter dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane through transition of fasciculata cells from pluripotent state and higher proliferative potential to differentiation. Activation of the alternative mechanism of growth control may probably affect maintenance of tissue homeostasis of zona fasciculata in postnatal development.",,,"Benzhydryl Compounds,Binding Sites,Cell Line, Tumor,Computer Simulation,Endocrine Disruptors,Estrogen Receptor alpha,Estrogens, Non-Steroidal,Humans,Phenols,Sulfones,Transcriptional Activation"
32721521,-98,,,Urinary bisphenol A concentrations and in vitro fertilization outcomes among women from a fertility clinic.,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is a widespread environmental endocrine disrupting chemical. Although many animals and in vitro studies reported that BPA may affect female fertility through the effect on maturing oocytes and meiotic cell division, but the data from human studies are limited and inconclusive. The study was conducted to examine the association between urinary BPA concentration and in vitro reproductive outcomes (metaphase II (MII) oocyte yield, top quality embryo, fertilization rate, implantation rate and clinical pregnancy) among women from an infertility clinic. The study participants were enrolled in the Infertility Center in Poland. 450 women aged 24-44 (n = 674 IVF cycles) provided urine samples. The urinary concentrations of BPA were evaluated using validated gas chromatography ion-tap mass spectrometry method. Clinical outcomes of IVF treatment were abstracted from patients electronic chart records. To assess the relationship between urinary BPA concentrations early examined reproductive outcomes generalized linear mixed models were used. The detection rate of BPA in urine samples was 98% and the geometric mean 1.59 ¬± 2.15 ng/ml. A significant decrease was observed between urinary concentration of BPA and implantation (p = 0.04) and decreased MII oocyte count (p = 0.03). There was no association between other examined IVF outcomes: embryo quality, fertilization rate and clinical pregnancy and BPA exposure. Exposure to BPA may have a negative effect during the early stages of human development. The studies among the larger and more diverse population are needed to confirm the results.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Phenols,bisphenol A","Agonist,Antagonist,Bisphenol,Dispersion force,Electrostatic interaction,Estrogen receptor","Benzhydryl Compounds,Binding Sites,Cyclohexanes,Endocrine Disruptors,Estrogen Antagonists,Estrogen Receptor alpha,Estrogen Receptor beta,Estrogens,HeLa Cells,Humans,Molecular Structure,Phenols,Protein Binding,Structure-Activity Relationship"
33779718,-98,,,Association Between Gestational Exposure to Toxicants and Autistic Behaviors Using Bayesian Quantile Regression.,"Autism spectrum disorder, which is characterized by impaired social communication and stereotypic behaviors, affects 1%-2% of children. Although prenatal exposure to toxicants has been associated with autistic behaviors, most studies have been focused on shifts in mean behavior scores. We used Bayesian quantile regression to assess the associations between log2-transformed toxicant concentrations and autistic behaviors across the distribution of behaviors. We used data from the Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals study, a pan-Canadian cohort (2008-2011). We measured metal, pesticide, polychlorinated biphenyl, phthalate, bisphenol-A, and triclosan concentrations in blood or urine samples collected during the first trimester of pregnancy. Using the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), in which higher scores denote more autistic-like behaviors, autistic behaviors were assessed in 478 children aged 3-4 years old. Lead, cadmium, and most phthalate metabolites were associated with mild increases in SRS scores at the 90th percentile of the SRS distribution. Manganese and some pesticides were associated with mild decreases in SRS scores at the 90th percentile of the SRS distribution. We identified several monotonic trends in which associations increased in magnitude from the bottom to the top of the SRS distribution. These results suggest that quantile regression can reveal nuanced relationships and, thus, should be more widely used by epidemiologists.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Metals, Heavy,Pesticides,Phenols,Phthalic Acids,Triclosan,phthalic acid,Polychlorinated Biphenyls,bisphenol A",,"Benzhydryl Compounds,Biodegradation, Environmental,Biomass,Chlorophyll,Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Pollution,Medical Waste Disposal,Panicum,Peroxidase,Phenols,Plant Roots,United States,Waste Management,Water"

Further, there is evidence that exposure to some of these chemicals is associated with reproductive toxicity. Using a high-content imaging approach, we assessed the effects of exposure to 9 OPEs on cells related to reproductive function: KGN human granulosa cells, MA-10 mouse Leydig cells, and C18-4 mouse spermatogonial cells. The effects of OPEs were compared with those of 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), a legacy brominated flame retardant. Alterations in several important cell features, including cell survival, mitochondrial dynamics, oxidative stress, lysosomes, and lipid droplets, were analyzed. Most of the OPEs tested displayed higher cytotoxicity than BDE-47 in all 3 cell lines. Effects on phenotypic parameters were specific for each cell type. Several OPEs increased total mitochondria, decreased lysosomes, increased the total area of lipid droplets, and induced oxidative stress in KGN cells; these endpoints were differentially affected in MA-10 and C18-4 cells. Alterations in cell phenotypes were highly correlated in the 2 steroidogenic cell lines for a few triaryl OPEs. Potency ranking using 2 complementary approaches, Toxicological Prioritization Index analyses and the lowest benchmark concentration/administered equivalent dose method, revealed that while most of the OPEs tested were more potent than BDE-47, others showed little to no effect. We propose that these approaches serve as lines of evidence in a screening strategy to identify the potential for reproductive and endocrine effects of emerging chemicals and assist in regulatory decision-making.","Esters,Flame Retardants,Organophosphates,Plasticizers","Bisphenol A,Environmental parameters,Functional bacterial groups,Natural biofilms,Nonylphenol,Pollution levels,Urban rivers","Benzhydryl Compounds,Biofilms,China,Nitrogen,Phenols,RNA, Ribosomal, 16S,Rivers,Water Pollutants, Chemical,Water Quality"
35102696,-98,,,Cypermethrin inhibits Leydig cell development and function in pubertal rats.,"Cypermethrin is a broad-spectrum pyrethroid insecticide that is widely used. It may induce adverse endocrine-disrupting effects on the male reproductive system. Whether cypermethrin can disrupt Leydig cell development and function in the late puberty remains elusive. The objective of this study was to explore the effect of cypermethrin exposure to male rats on the development and function of Leydig cells in late puberty and explore the underlying mechanism. Thirty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats (age of 35‚Äâdays) were gavaged with cypermethrin (0, 12.5, 25, and 50‚Äâmg/kg/day) from postnatal day 35-49. Cypermethrin significantly lowered serum testosterone level while elevating serum luteinizing hormone level at a dose of 50‚Äâmg/kg, without altering serum follicle-stimulating hormone level. Cypermethrin markedly decreased CYP11A1-positive Leydig cell number at 50‚Äâmg/kg without affecting SOX9-positive Sertoli cell number. It significantly down-regulated the expression of Leydig cell genes, Lhcgr, Star, Cyp11a1, and Cyp17a1 and their proteins, while up-regulating the expression of Sertoli cell genes, Dhh and Amh, and their proteins, at doses of 12.5-50‚Äâmg/kg. In addition, cypermethrin significantly increased malondialdehyde level while lowering the expression of Sod1 and Sod2 and their proteins at 50‚Äâmg/kg. Cypermethrin markedly induced reactive oxidative species at a concentration of 200‚ÄâŒºM and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential at 25‚ÄâŒºM and higher concentrations after 24‚Äâh of treatment to primary Leydig cells in vitro. In conclusion, cypermethrin inhibits the development and function of Leydig cells in male rats in late puberty.","Pyrethrins,cypermethrin,Testosterone",,"Benzhydryl Compounds,Biomass,Catalysis,Conservation of Natural Resources,Green Chemistry Technology,Phenols"
33839502,-98,,,Multigenerational impacts of gestational bisphenol A exposure on the sperm function and fertility of male mice.,"Growing evidence suggests that developmental exposure to bisphenol A (BPA)-a synthetic endocrine disruptor-causes atypical reproductive phenotypes that may persist for generations. However, the precise mechanism(s) by which BPA causes these adverse consequences is unclear. Here, pregnant female mice were orally exposed to 50¬†Œºg, 5¬†mg, and 50¬†mg BPA/kg body weight (bw)/day from 7 to 14 days of gestation. Corn oil treatments were used as control. The first filial generation (F1) and F2 males were used to generate F3 by mating them with unexposed females. High BPA doses impaired F1 and/or F1-F2 (multigenerational effect) male reproduction (i.e., disrupted testicular germ cell organization and spermatogenesis, altered sperm biochemical properties, and decreased sperm count, motility, and fertility) but not that of F3 males (transgenerational effect). Moreover, the observed multigenerational transmission of the abnormal reproductive traits was associated with alterations in the sperm DNA methylation patterns of specific male generations, with substantial proteomic changes in F1-F3 at the highest BPA dose. Given that the proteins related to male fertility and epigenetic modification are highly conserved among vertebrates, our findings may shed light on how exposure to environmental factors during pregnancy affects fertility in future generations in both humans and the other animals.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Phenols,bisphenol A","bisphenol A,endocrine disruptor,haemodialysis","Benzhydryl Compounds,Blood Vessels,Filtration,Humans,Kidney,Phenols,Plastics,Renal Dialysis,Renal Insufficiency, Chronic"

In the present study, we exposed those mice to BBP 10 days prior to surgery and 4 weeks after surgery at physiologically relevant doses to mimic human exposure. Chronic exposure to BBP did not promote the growth of endometriotic lesions; however, the lesion survival rate in BBP-treated mice did increase significantly compared with control mice. Multiparametric flow cytometry showed that BBP exposure did not affect the homeostasis of infiltrated immune subsets in lesions but did enhance CD44 (adhesion marker) expression on plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). Blocking CD44 interactions locally inhibited endometriotic lesion growth. Immunofluorescence results further confirmed that CD44 blocking inhibited pDC infiltration and reduced the frequency of CD44 pDCs in endometriotic tissues.

33182144,-98,,,Transgenerational effects on intestinal inflammation status in mice perinatally exposed to bisphenol S.,"Increasing evidence has highlighted the critical role of early life environment in shaping the future health outcomes of individuals in subsequent generations. Bisphenol S (BPS) has been widely used as a substitute for various plastic materials due to the limited application of Bisphenol A (BPA) which is an endocrine disruptor. However, the lack of efficient evaluation of BPS leaves doubts about the relevant substitute of BPA. Few studies of transgenerational inheritance have examined the effects of environmental exposures to endocrine disruptors on the immune system. In this study, we analyzed the transgenerational effects of BPS on intestinal inflammation and its consequence in metabolism. In this study, only F0 pregnant mice were exposed to BPS (1.5¬†Œºg/kg¬†bw/day) from gestational day 0 until weaning of offspring. In this work, both F1 and F2 male offspring developed an inflammatory response in the ileum and colon at adulthood after F0 mothers were exposed to BPS; this phenomenon disappeared in F3. This inflammatory response in F1 male offspring is associated with a significant decrease of blood cholesterol without modification of metabolic status. Further, in F3 offspring male, the decrease of gut inflammatory response is associated with a decrease of fat weight and with an increase of blood glucose and cholesterol level. A sex-specific profile is observed in female offspring. We also observed that early life exposure to BPS was associated with strong abnormal intestinal immune status. The study presented here demonstrates that the immune system, like other organ systems, is vulnerable to transgenerational effects caused by environmental exposures.","Blood Glucose,Cytokines,Endocrine Disruptors,Phenols,Sulfones,bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)sulfone","Bisphenol,Estrogen receptor,Microplastic,Next generation sequencing,Tetramethyl bisphenol A","Benzhydryl Compounds,Breast Neoplasms,Cell Line,Cell Line, Tumor,Cell Proliferation,Down-Regulation,Endocrine Disruptors,Estradiol,Estrogen Receptor alpha,Estrogens,Female,Gene Expression,HEK293 Cells,Humans,MCF-7 Cells,Phenols,Plasticizers,Signal Transduction,Up-Regulation"

Few studies have reported PCP exposure in pregnant women and its association with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). This nested case-control study aimed to determine the concentration of urinary PCP in early pregnancy and explore the association between PCP exposure and GDM risk. This study included 293 GDM cases and 586 non-GDM controls matched by fetal sex and maternal age from a birth cohort in Wuhan, China. PCP concentrations in spot urine samples collected between 8 and 16 weeks of gestation were measured by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Conditional logistic regression was used to assess the association between PCP exposure and the odds ratio of GDM. The median concentrations of specific gravity-adjusted PCP in controls and cases were 0.70 and 0.80 ng/mL, respectively, with no significant differences (P > 0.05). The multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) (95% confidence intervals) for GDM across quartiles of urinary PCP were 1 (reference), 1.63 (1.06-2.50), 1.70 (1.11-2.61), and 1.35 (0.87-2.08), respectively, showing a potential ""inverted-U"" shaped association. In addition, PCP levels and maternal age or fetal sex had significant interactions with GDM risk (both P for interaction < 0.05). Among older women and those carrying female fetuses, the ORs of GDM risk were higher. This study suggests that pregnant women in central China are widely exposed to PCP, and this is the first time to report that PCP exposure may increase the risk of GDM (with potential effect modifications by maternal age and fetal sex). The association observed is in agreement with PCP's ""inverted-U"" anti-estrogenic effect in vivo; thus, such an effect in humans at environmentally relevant doses should be studied further.","Endocrine Disruptors,Pentachlorophenol","bisphenols,breast cancer,endocrine-disrupting compounds,phthalates,serum levels","Benzhydryl Compounds,Breast Neoplasms,Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Exposure,Female,Humans,Phenols,Phthalic Acids,Plasticizers,Survivors"
20563929,-98,,,Effects of gestational and lactational fenvalerate exposure on immune and reproductive systems of male rats.,"The aim of this study was to determine the consequent reproductive developmental and immunotoxic effects due to exposure to fenvalerate during pregnancy and lactation in male offspring of maternal-treated rats. Pregnant rats were treated daily by oral gavage with 40 or 80 mg/kg of fenvalerate or corn oil (vehicle, control), from d 12 of pregnancy to d 21 of lactation. Immune and reproductive developmental effects were assessed in male offspring at postnatal days (PND) 40 (peripuberty), 60 (postpuberty), and 90 (sexual maturity). Treatment with the higher dose (80 mg/kg) resulted in convulsive behavior, hyperexcitability, and mortality in 45% of the dams. Fenvalerate was detected in the fetus due to placental transfer, as well as in pups due to breast-milk ingestion, persisting in male offspring until PND 40 even though pesticide treatment was terminated on PND 20. However, fenvalerate did not produce marked alterations in age of testicular descent to the scrotum and prepucial separation, parameters indicative of puberty initiation. In contrast, at puberty, there was a reduction in testicular weight and sperm production in male offspring of maternal-treated rats. At adulthood, the sperm counts and fertility did not differ between control and treated groups. Testosterone levels were not changed at any time during reproductive development. Similarly, no apparent exposure-related effects were detected in the histological structures of the lymphohematopoietic system. Data indicate that fenvalerate, in this experimental model, interfered with initial development of the male reproductive system, but that these effects on sperm production or fertility did not persist into adulthood. There was no apparent evidence that fenvalerate altered testosterone levels or produced a disruption in male endocrine functions.","Nitriles,Pesticides,Pyrethrins,Testosterone,fenvalerate","bisphenol A,breast cancer,endocrine-disrupting chemicals,meta-analysis,phthalates","Benzhydryl Compounds,Breast Neoplasms,Environmental Exposure,Environmental Pollutants,Female,Humans,Phenols,Phthalic Acids"

32702508,-98,,,Maternal vitamin D supplementation inhibits bisphenol A-induced proliferation of Th17 cells in adult offspring.,"Bisphenol A (BPA) exposure can increase the risk of immune-related diseases in later life. Vitamin D3 (Vit D3) has been shown to have multiple immunomodulatory actions and has been used to treat immune diseases. However, the potential beneficial effects of Vit D3 on BPA-induced adverse effects in the immune system have not explored. We hypothesize that VitD3 may ameliorate BPA-induced side effects in the immune system, even in offspring of VitD3-supplemented mothers. Here, we established our experimental model by exposing pregnant dams with 1000¬†nM BPA with or without VitD3 (0.25¬†Œºg/kg, 1¬†Œºg/kg and 4¬†Œºg/kg) treatment. We show that mother's exposure to BPA increases proliferation of the spleen T helper 17 (Th17) cells and serum protein level of IL-17 in the offspring; however, VitD3 supplementation in mothers dose-dependently ameliorated these BPA-induced side effects on the immune system in the offspring as evidenced by attenuated upregulation of Th17 proliferation, and RORŒ≥t, IL-17, IL-6, and IL-23 expressions in the offspring. Our data provide the first evidence that maternal VitD3 supplementation offers benefits to the offspring by attenuating BPA-induced side effects on the immune system through vitamin D receptor (VDR)-dependent regulation of transcription factors and cytokines, suggesting its translational potential.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Estrogens, Non-Steroidal,Interleukin-23,Interleukin-6,Phenols,interleukin-6, mouse,Vitamin D,bisphenol A","Adsorption,Bisphenol a,Fe/cu@NC-x,Mechanism,Peroxymonosulfate","Benzhydryl Compounds,Carbon,Humans,Peroxides,Phenols"

16919686,-98,,,Distinct endocrine effects of chronic haloperidol or risperidone administration in male rats.,"Antipsychotic drugs have been used effectively for the treatment of schizophrenia symptoms, but they are often associated with metabolic side effects such as weight gain and endocrine disruptions. To investigate the possible mechanisms of antipsychotic-induced metabolic effects, we studied the impact of chronic administration of a typical antipsychotic drug (haloperidol) and an atypical antipsychotic (risperidone) to male rats on food intake, body weight, adiposity, and the circulating concentrations of hormones and metabolites that can influence energy homeostasis. Chronic (28days) haloperidol administration had no effect on food intake, weight gain or adiposity in male rats, whereas risperidone treatment resulted in a transient reduction in food intake and significantly reduced body weight gain compared to vehicle-treated control rats. Whereas neither antipsychotic had any effect on serum lipid profiles, glucose tolerance or the circulating concentrations of hormones controlled by the hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid (free T4), -adrenal (corticosterone), -somatotropic (IGF-1), or -gonadotropic axes (testosterone), haloperidol increased circulating insulin levels and risperidone increased serum glucagon levels. This finding suggests that haloperidol or risperidone induce distinct metabolic effects. Since metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus represent serious health issues, understanding antipsychotic-induced endocrine and metabolic effects may ultimately allow better control of these side effects.","Antipsychotic Agents,Insulin,Testosterone,Glucagon,Haloperidol,Risperidone,Corticosterone","Bisphenol A,bisphenol A alternatives,children,endocrine disruption,hazard assessment,pregnant woman,reproductive toxicity,sensitive populations","Benzhydryl Compounds,Carcinogens,Endocrine Disruptors,Humans,Phenols,Reproduction,Sulfones"

In animal studies there is evidence that suggests certain PFAs can disrupt thyroid hormone homeostasis. A commonly reported condition in exposed animals is hypothyroxinemia, whereby serum free thyroxine (fT4) is decreased despite normal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations. We designed an individually matched case-control study to investigate whether exposure to perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was associated with hypothyroxinemia in pregnant women from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, in 2005-2006, who underwent a ""triple screen"" blood test at 15-20 weeks gestation as part of ante-natal care. Thyroid hormones, fT4 and TSH, were measured in serum from 974 women, and from these we measured PFAs in the sera of 96 hypothyroxinemic cases (normal TSH, the lowest 10th percentile of fT4) and 175 controls (normal TSH, fT4 between the 50th and 90th percentiles) matched on age and referring physician. Analyses by conditional logistic regression indicated that the concentrations of PFAs in this population were not associated with hypothyroxinemia among pregnant women. The current findings do not support a causal link between PFA exposure and maternal hypothyroxinemia in the studied population.","Alkanesulfonic Acids,Caprylates,Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Pollutants,Fluorocarbons,Sulfonic Acids,perfluorohexanesulfonic acid,perfluorooctanoic acid,perfluorooctane sulfonic acid,Thyroxine","Bisphenol A,biotechnology,culturally appropriate technology,endocrine disrupters,endocrinology,environment,neoplasms,plastics","Benzhydryl Compounds,Carcinogens,Humans,Male,Phenols,Plastics,Sulfones"

TDF promoted significant increases in both duodenal and pancreatic Œ±-amylase and lipase especially in the 12-weeks treated rats. Plasmatic glucose and lipid profile; total cholesterol (T-cholesterol), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c) and glyceride, were markedly disrupted. Compared with controls, biochemical liver injury parameters: aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were significantly increased. Moreover, notable pathological features were reported in liver tissues. These results confirm a strong relationship between exposure to an endocrine disruptor and metabolic disorders. In fact, subchronic exposure to TDF lead to lipidemic and glycemic disruption associated hyperactivity in both Œ±-amylase and lipase. Overall, these disruptions could be an important step on the pathway to metabolic pathology.","Endocrine Disruptors,Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated,Lipase,alpha-Amylases,tetradifon","bisphenol A,connexin 43,gap junctional intercellular communication,granulosa cells","Benzhydryl Compounds,Cell Communication,Cell Survival,Cells, Cultured,Connexin 43,Dose-Response Relationship, Drug,Down-Regulation,Female,Gap Junctions,Granulosa Cells,Humans,Phenols"

35955852,-97,,,Adult Exposure to Di-N-Butyl Phthalate (DBP) Induces Persistent Effects on Testicular Cell Markers and Testosterone Biosynthesis in Mice.,"Studies indicate that phthalates are endocrine disruptors affecting reproductive health. One of the most commonly used phthalates, di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), has been linked with adverse reproductive health outcomes in men, but the mechanisms behind these effects are still poorly understood. Here, adult male mice were orally exposed to DBP (10 or 100 mg/kg/day) for five weeks, and the testis and adrenal glands were collected one week after the last dose, to examine more persistent effects. Quantification of testosterone, androstenedione, progesterone and corticosterone concentrations by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry showed that testicular testosterone was significantly decreased in both DBP treatment groups, whereas the other steroids were not significantly altered. Western blot analysis of testis revealed that DBP exposure increased the levels of the steroidogenic enzymes CYP11A1, HSD3Œ≤2, and CYP17A1, the oxidative stress marker nitrotyrosine, and the luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR). The analysis further demonstrated increased levels of the germ cell marker DAZL, the Sertoli cell markers vimentin and SOX9, and the Leydig cell marker SULT1E1. Overall, the present work provides more mechanistic understanding of how adult DBP exposure can induce effects on the male reproductive system by affecting several key cells and proteins important for testosterone biosynthesis and spermatogenesis, and for the first time shows that these effects persist at least one week after the last dose. It also demonstrates impairment of testosterone biosynthesis at a lower dose than previously reported.","Dibutyl Phthalate,Testosterone","Bottled water,Emerging contaminants,Food and beverages,Hormones,Miniaturized sample preparation methods,Plasticizers","Benzhydryl Compounds,Child,Drinking Water,Endocrine Disruptors,Humans,Mineral Waters,Solid Phase Extraction,Tandem Mass Spectrometry,Water Pollutants, Chemical"
35171999,-97,,,The Analgesic Dipyrone Affects Pregnancy Outcomes and Endocrine-Sensitive Endpoints in Female and Male Offspring Rats.,"Dipyrone is an analgesic and antipyretic drug commonly used in many countries. Although generally not recommended during pregnancy, it is known that many women use dipyrone during the gestational period. In this study, we investigated the endocrine and reproductive effects of dipyrone in female and male offspring rats exposed in utero from gestational days 10-21. Pregnant rats were treated with dipyrone at 25, 75, and 225‚Äâmg/kg/day via oral gavage. Developmental landmarks-anogenital index (AGI), number of nipples, vaginal opening, first estrus, and preputial separation-were evaluated in the offspring. Reproductive parameters, including estrous cycle regularity, daily sperm production, weight and histopathology of reproductive organs, steroid hormone levels, and gene expression of selected markers of reproductive function were assessed at adulthood. At the highest dose, dipyrone induced a significant increase in postimplantation losses/fetal death and delayed parturition in dams. Offspring exposed in utero to the highest dose also exhibited significant changes in some early life markers of endocrine disruption, in particular increased AGI in females, indicating a proandrogenic effect, and increased rate of retained nipples in males, indicating an antiandrogenic response. No changes were observed in markers of puberty onset or reproductive parameters at adulthood. These results suggest that exposure to therapeutically relevant doses of dipyrone may induce mild endocrine disruptive effects that can be detected in late pregnancy and early life. Such effects may be relevant considering dipyrone use by pregnant women and the possibility of coexposures with other endocrine disruptors.","Analgesics,Endocrine Disruptors,Dipyrone","Endocrine disrupting chemicals,LC-MS/MS,Personal care products,health risk assessment,human exposure","Benzhydryl Compounds,Chromatography, Liquid,Cosmetics,Environmental Exposure,Female,Humans,Parabens,Phenols,Risk Assessment,Tandem Mass Spectrometry,Young Adult"
32017950,-97,,,Obesogenic effects of chlorpyrifos and its metabolites during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes.,"Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is an organophosphorus pesticide widely and extensively used in agriculture in more than one hundred countries and found ubiquitously in the environment. The present study was aimed at providing a better understanding of the obesogenic potential of CPF and its metabolites, as well as to evaluate their effects on the adipocyte differentiation process. For it, during the initial differentiation process, 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes were exposed to different concentrations of CPF, CPF-oxon (CPO), or 3,5,6-trichloropyridinol (TCP), which did not affect cell survival. Results showed how CPF and, to a lesser extent, its metabolite TCP, had a positive metabolic influence over the adipogenic process by fostering an increase in the number of differentiated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, and by enhancing the capacity to store lipid droplets. These processes seem to occur through the upregulation of the transcription factors CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein Œ± (C/EBPŒ±) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Œ≥ (PPARŒ≥), which are related to a significant higher expression of the fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) adipokine. Based on this finding, CPF exposure could be one of the many factors that contributes to the worldwide increase in the incidence of obesity. However, additional investigations are clearly needed.","Endocrine Disruptors,Insecticides,Pyridones,O,O-diethyl O-3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridyl phosphate,3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol,Chlorpyrifos","BPA,human exposure,liquid chromatography‚Äì mass spectrometry,solid phase extraction","Benzhydryl Compounds,Chromatography, Liquid,Drinking Water,Endocrine Disruptors,Humans,Limit of Detection,Phenols,Reference Standards,Solid Phase Extraction,Tandem Mass Spectrometry,Water Pollutants, Chemical"

In aquatic invertebrates, the modes of action of most EDs are largely unknown, due to partial knowledge of the mechanisms controlling neuroendocrine functions. In the marine bivalve Mytilus galloprovincialis, TBBPA has been previously shown to affect larval development in the 48 h larval toxicity assay at environmental concentrations. In this work, the effects of TBBPA were further investigated at different times post-fertilization. TBBPA, from 1 Œºg/L, affected shell biogenesis at 48 hours post fertilization-hpf, as shown by phenotypic and SEM analysis. The mechanisms of action of TBBPA were investigated at concentrations of the same order of magnitude as those found in highly polluted coastal areas (10 Œºg/L). At 28-32 hpf, TBBPA significantly affected deposition of both the organic matrix and CaCO in the shell. TBBPA also altered expression of shell-related genes from 24 to 48 hpf, in particular of tyrosinase, a key enzyme in shell matrix remodeling. At earlier stages (24 hpf), TBBPA affected the development of dopaminergic, serotoninergic and GABAergic systems, as shown by in situ hybridization-ISH and immunocytochemistry. These data contribute draw adverse outcome pathways-AOPs, where TBBPA affects the synthesis of neutrotransmitters involved in key events (neurodevelopment and shell biogenesis), resulting in phenotypic changes on individuals (delayed or arrested development) that might lead to detrimental consequences on populations.'}","Flame Retardants,Polybrominated Biphenyls,tetrabromobisphenol A","Bisphenol A,Hormones,LC-MS/MS,Solid phase extraction,Water quality","Benzhydryl Compounds,Chromatography, Liquid,Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Monitoring,Estradiol,Estrogens,Estrone,Ethinyl Estradiol,Hormones,Lakes,Phenols,Philippines,Rivers,Tandem Mass Spectrometry,Water Pollutants, Chemical"

32503345,-97,,,Perinatal Exposure to Triclosan Results in Abnormal Brain Development and Behavior in Mice.,"Triclosan (TCS) is one of the most common endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) present in household and personal wash products. Recently, concerns have been raised about the association between abnormal behavior in children and exposure to EDC during gestation. We hypothesized that exposure to TCS during gestation could affect brain development. Cortical neurons of mice were exposed in vitro to TCS. In addition, we examined in vivo whether maternal TCS administration can affect neurobehavioral development in the offspring generation. We determined that TCS can impair dendrite and axon growth by reducing average length and numbers of axons and dendrites. Additionally, TCS inhibited the proliferation of and promoted apoptosis in neuronal progenitor cells. Detailed behavioral analyses showed impaired acquisition of spatial learning and reference memory in offspring derived from dams exposed to TCS. The TCS-treated groups also showed cognition dysfunction and impairments in sociability and social novelty preference. Furthermore, TCS-treated groups exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior, but there was no significant change in depression-like behaviors. In addition, TCS-treated groups exhibited deficits in nesting behavior. Taken together, our results indicate that perinatal exposure to TCS induces neurodevelopment disorder, resulting in abnormal social behaviors, cognitive impairment, and deficits in spatial learning and memory in offspring.","Anti-Infective Agents, Local,Triclosan","Bisphenol,Fetal growth,Pregnant women,Twins","Benzhydryl Compounds,Cohort Studies,Female,Humans,Maternal Exposure,Phenols,Pregnancy,Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects,Reproducibility of Results"
35779701,-97,,,The alternative analog plasticizer BPS displays similar phenotypic and metabolomic responses to BPA in HepG2 and INS-1E cells.,"Bisphenols A (BPA) and S (BPS) are endocrine-disrupting chemicals that affect energy metabolism, leading to impairment of glucose and lipid homeostasis. We aimed at identifying metabolic pathways regulated by both compounds in human liver cells and rat pancreatic Œ≤-cells that could impair energy homeostasis regulation. We assessed the effects on growth, proliferation, and viability of hepatocarcinoma (HepG2) and insulinoma (INS-1E) cells exposed to either BPA or BPS in a full range concentration between 0.001 and 100¬†ŒºM. Both the dose and duration of exposure caused a differential response on growth and viability of both cells. Effects were more pronounced on HepG2, as these cells exhibited non-linear dose-responses following exposure to xenobiotics. For INS-1E, effect was observed only at the highest concentration. In addition, we profiled their intracellular state by untargeted metabolomics at 24, 48, and 72¬†h of exposure. This analysis revealed time- and dose-dependently molecular changes for HepG2 and INS-1E that were similar between BPA and BPS. Both increased levels of inflammatory mediators, such as metabolites pertaining to linolenic and linoleic acid metabolic pathway. In summary, this study shows that BPS also disrupts molecular functions in cells that regulate energy homeostasis, displaying similar but less pronounced responses than BPA.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Plasticizers,Sulfones,Glucose","bisphenol,endocrine disruptor,epidemiology,male fertility,semen quality","Benzhydryl Compounds,Cross-Sectional Studies,Denmark,Female,Humans,Male,Phenols,Pregnancy,Semen Analysis,Sperm Motility,Young Adult"
32660331,-97,,,Genome-wide DNA methylation differences and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposure in a US population.,"Exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), an endocrine-disrupting compound, is ubiquitous despite decades-old bans on the manufacture and use of PCBs. Increased exposure to PCBs is associated with adverse health consequences throughout life, including type 2 diabetes and cancer. PCB exposure is also associated with alterations in epigenetic marks and gene transcription, which could lead to adverse health outcomes, but many of these are population-specific. To further investigate the association between PCB and epigenetic marks, DNA methylation was measured at 787,684 CpG sites in 641 peripheral blood samples from the Michigan Polybrominated Biphenyl (PBB) Registry. 1345 CpGs were associated with increased total PCB level after controlling for age, sex, and 24 surrogate variables (FDR < 0.05). These CpGs were enriched in active promoter and transcription associated regions (p¬†<¬†0.05), and in regions around the binding sites for transcription factors involved in xenobiotic metabolism and immune function (FDR < 0.05). PCB exposure also associated with proportions of CD4T, NK, and granulocyte cell types, and with the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (p¬†<¬†0.05), and the estimated effect sizes of PCB on the epigenome were correlated with the effect sizes previously reported in an epigenome-wide study of C-reactive protein (r¬†=¬†0.29; p =¬†2.22e-5), supporting previous studies on the association between PCB and immune dysfunction. These results indicate that PCB exposure is associated with differences in epigenetic marks in active regions of the genome, and future work should investigate whether these may mediate the association between PCB and health consequences.","Endocrine Disruptors,Polybrominated Biphenyls,Polychlorinated Biphenyls","Bisphenol A exposure,Inflammatory biomarkers,Insulin resistance,Lipid peroxidation,Pakistani population","Benzhydryl Compounds,Cross-Sectional Studies,Diabetes Mellitus,Humans,Pakistan,Phenols"

Moreover, there is growing evidence that food chemical contaminants, especially lipophilic ones such as PBDEs, could interact with different components of the diet. The objective of the present study was to assess the association between dietary intake of PBDEs and breast cancer risk in the French E3N cohort study, and to investigate the potential modification of this association by vegetable oil consumption. The study included 67879 women. Intakes of eight PBDEs were estimated using food consumption data from a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire, and food contamination levels measured by the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety (ANSES). Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate Hazard Ratios (HR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) for the association between total PBDEs dietary intake and breast cancer risk. Interaction measures for vegetable oil consumption were estimated on both additive and multiplicative scales.

We studied the effect of DBP and DEHP on critical enzymes of glucocorticoid biosynthesis pathway in the adrenal gland and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum in male Wistar rats. DEHP and DBP treatment altered the mRNA expression of enzymes of glucocorticoid biosynthesis pathway accompanied by a reduction in glucocorticoid production and elevation in the level of glucocorticoid regulated pro-inflammatory cytokines indicating a cascading effect of phthalates. The analysis of PPI (protein - protein interaction) network involving Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) of enzymes through STRING database revealed that all the proteins have the maximum level of interaction with the selected number of proteins.

35700788,-96,x,x,Environmental polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon exposure in relation to metabolic syndrome in US adults.,"The present study examined the associations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) exposure with metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components. Data were from 5181 US adults recruited in the National Health and Nutrition Examine Survey 2001-2012. Environmental PAH exposure was estimated as concentrations of urinary PAH metabolites. Weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression and modified Poisson regression were separately conducted to estimate the associations of mixed and single PAH metabolites with MetS and its components. WQS regression analyses showed that participants with higher mixed PAH exposure had increased prevalence of MetS (prevalence ratio, 1.12; 95 % confidence interval, 1.06, 1.19), elevated waist circumference (1.07; 1.02, 1.12), elevated fasting blood glucose (1.07; 1.00, 1.14), elevated triglycerides (1.19; 1.09, 1.30), and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.11; 1.03, 1.20). In the models for single PAH metabolites, higher levels of 1-hydroxynaphthalene (1.15; 1.00, 1.32), 2-hydroxynaphthalene (1.20; 1.05, 1.38), 1-hydroxyphenanthrene (1.18; 1.04, 1.34), 2-hydroxyphenanthrene (1.38; 1.22, 1.57), and 1-pyrene (1.19; 1.05, 1.34) were respectively associated with increased prevalence of MetS (highest tertile vs lowest tertile). In addition, linear trends were noted for the associations of these PAH metabolites with MetS (all P for linear association ‚â§0.047). Smokers, drinkers, and participants with poor diet quality showed stronger associations between certain PAH metabolite with MetS. The findings suggest that the prevalence of MetS and its components increases when PAH exposure is at a high level, and that lifestyle factors, such as cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, and diet quality, could modify the positive associations of certain PAH exposure with MetS.",Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons,"Biodegradation,Carcinogenicity,Endocrine disruption,Human exposure,Photodegradation","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Humans,Phenols,Reproduction"
18929547,-96,,,Modest effects of repeated fluoxetine on estrous cyclicity and sexual behavior in Sprague Dawley female rats.,"In an earlier study, we reported that daily fluoxetine treatment (10 mg/kg/day) rapidly disrupted estrous cyclicity and sexual receptivity in adult, regularly cycling Fischer rats. The current study was designed to investigate if comparable fluoxetine treatment would similarly affect intact, regularly cycling Sprague Dawley rats. In the first experiment, fluoxetine was injected for 24 days. After 11-14 days of daily fluoxetine treatment, 40% of the rats showed a transient disturbance of the estrous cycle with elimination of sexual receptivity. In these affected rats, reduced sexual receptivity generally preceded disruption of vaginal cyclicity. In a second experiment, a shorter exposure was used to attempt to dissociate effects of fluoxetine on behavior and estrous cyclicity. Nine days of fluoxetine treatment eliminated sexual receptivity and proceptivity (hops/darts) in 40% and 46%, respectively, of rats without altering the estrous cycle. Female rats then received a 10th fluoxetine injection 30 min prior to assessment of sexual motivation (measured with the male preference paradigm). There was no effect of fluoxetine on male preference, but fluoxetine significantly reduced the number of crossings and seconds of grooming during preference testing. Therefore, effects of fluoxetine on estrous cyclicity and behavior of Sprague Dawley female rats were smaller and required longer to develop than previously reported in Fischer female rats. These findings reinforce a probable relationship between fluoxetine's effect on sexual activity and neuroendocrine disturbances and illustrate the importance of strain selection in attempting to model human disease.","Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors,Fluoxetine","BPA,Biomarker,Dose-response,Effective concentration,MCF-7,Metabolomics","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Metabolomics,Phenols"
32626472,-96,,,Assessment of the endocrine disrupting properties of Bisphenol AF according to the EU criteria and ECHA/EFSA guidance.,"Endocrine disruptors (EDs) are exogenous compounds that interfere with the hormone system, affecting human health and environment. Specific legislative obligations have been introduced in the European Union (EU) to gradually eliminate EDs in water, industrial chemicals and pesticides. However, identification of EDs is the first and essential step towards regulation and appropriate risk management. Scientific criteria and guidance for ED assessment have recently been established for pesticides in the EU. In this project, the ED properties of the non-pesticide chemical Bisphenol AF (BPAF), analogue and potential substitute of Bisphenol A were evaluated by the application of the EU criteria and guidance in the frame of human health risk assessment. A data dossier was built by a systematic literature review (WOS, Scopus, Pubmed, Embase), title/abstract screening (RAYYAN) and full-text examination. All relevant information was extracted and systematically reported, and reliability and relevance of data were assessed (SciRAP). Data were synthesised into lines of evidence for (i) endocrine activity, (ii) adversity and (iii) general toxicity, and weight of evidence evaluation was applied. The initial analysis of the evidence showed potential endocrine adverse effects and endocrine activity, meeting the ED criteria and leading the assessment to the mode of action (MoA) analysis. The biological plausibility of the link between the adverse effects and the endocrine activity was investigated based on current scientific knowledge. Empirical support for dose-response and temporal concordance was evaluated, and the key events were assessed in terms of essentiality, consistency, analogy and specificity. Finally, an overall conclusion of the ED properties of BPAF was drawn. The EU criteria and guidance for EDs assessment were successfully applied to BPAF demonstrating its endocrine activity and adversity based on weight of evidence methodology and MoA analysis. The Fellow greatly increased her knowledge and hands-on experience on ED assessment in the EU regulatory context contributing to implement transparency and structure in health risk assessment.",,"Bisphenol S,Environmental endocrine disruptor,Intestinal inflammation,Metabolomic,Transcriptomic","Benzhydryl Compounds,Environmental Pollutants,Humans,Inflammation,Phenols,Sulfones,Transcriptome"

The impact of low-dose exposure to DDT on the morphogenesis of the adrenal gland is still poorly understood. The development and function of zona glomerulosa in rats has been found to be associated with changes in the expression of the transcription factor Oct4 (Octamer 4), which is the most important player in cell pluripotency. The aim of the study was to investigate the morphogenesis and function of rat adrenal zona glomerulosa in rats exposed to low doses of DDT during prenatal and postnatal development and to determine the possible role of Oct4 in DDT-mediated structural and functional changes. The DDT-exposed rats demonstrated slower development and lower functional activity of the zona glomerulosa during the pubertal period associated with higher expression of Oct4. Further, accelerated growth and restoration of hormone production was associated with, firstly, a decrease in Oct4 expressing cells and secondly, the loss of the inverse relationship between basal aldosterone levels and the number of Oct4 expressing cells. Thus, the transcriptional factor Oct4 exhibited an altered pattern of expression in the DDT-exposed rats during postnatal development. The results of the study uncover a novel putative mechanism by which low doses of DDT disrupt the development of adrenal zona glomerulosa.","Octamer Transcription Factor-3,Aldosterone,DDT","Bisphenol A,Cardiovascular disease,Environmental pollution,Estrogen,Hypertension,Toxicology","Benzhydryl Compounds,Estrogens,Humans,Hypertension,Phenols"

Testes exposure to NP results in testicular structure disruption and a reduction in testicular size and testosterone levels. However, the effects of NP on spermatogonia in testes have not been fully elucidated. In this study, the molecular mechanisms of NP in GC-1 spermatogonia (spg) cells were investigated. We found that cell viability significantly decreased and apoptosis increased in a dose-dependent manner when GC-1 spg cells were exposed to NP. Furthermore, the expression levels of the pro-apoptotic proteins increased, whereas anti-apoptosis markers decreased in NP-exposed GC-1 spg cells. We also found that NP increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, suggesting that ROS-induced activation of the MAPK signaling pathway is the molecular mechanism of NP-induced apoptosis in GC-1 spg cells. Thus, NP could induce c-Jun phosphorylation; dose-dependent expression of JNK, MKK4, p53, and p38; and the subsequent inhibition of ERK1/2 and MEK1/2 phosphorylation. The genes involved in apoptosis and JNK signaling were also upregulated in GC-1 spg cells treated with NP compared to those in the controls. Our findings suggest that NP induces apoptosis through ROS/JNK signaling in GC-1 spg cells.","Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins,Phenols,Reactive Oxygen Species,nonylphenol","BPA biphasic behavior,BPA in pregnancy,Endocrine disruptor chemicals,Endometrial cells,In vitro models for reproduction,Trophoblast","Benzhydryl Compounds,Female,Humans,Maternal-Fetal Exchange,Models, Biological,Organ Specificity,Phenols,Pregnancy,Risk Factors"

Specifically, we measured 9 phthalate metabolites (MEP, MiBP, MnBP, MCMHP, MBzP, MEHHP, MEOHP, MECPP, MEHP) in the urine of 641 gestating women from the INMA study (Spain) and the forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1\xa0s (FEV) and FEV/FVC in their offspring at ages 4, 7, 9 and 11. We used linear regression and mixed linear regression with a random intercept for subject to assess the association between phthalates and lung function at each study visit and for the overall childhood, respectively. We also assessed the phthalate metabolites mixture effect on lung function using a Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) regression. We observed that the phthalate metabolites gestational levels were consistently associated with lower FVC and FEV at all ages, both when assessed individually and jointly as a mixture, although most associations were not statistically significant. Of note, a 10% increase in MiBP was related to lower FVC (-0.02 (-0.04, 0)) and FEV z-scores (-0.02 (-0.04, -0.01) at age 4. Similar significant reductions in FVC were observed at ages 4 and 7 associated with an increase in MEP and MnBP, respectively, and for FEV at age 4 associated with an increase in MBzP. WQS regression consistently identified MBzP as an important contributor to the phthalate mixture effect. We can conclude that the gestational exposure to phthalates was associated with children's lower FVC and FEV, especially in early childhood, and in a statistically significant manner for MEP, MiBP, MBzP and MnBP. Given the ubiquity of phthalate exposure and its established endocrine disrupting effects in children, our findings support current regulations that limit phthalate exposure.""}","Environmental Pollutants,Phthalic Acids,phthalic acid","Analogues,Bisphenol A,Environmental factors,Polycystic ovary syndrome","Benzhydryl Compounds,Female,Humans,Phenols,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,Tandem Mass Spectrometry"

Perfluorinated iodine alkanes (PFIs) possess estrogenic activities, while their potential neurodevelopmental toxicity remains blurry. In the present study, the effects of two PFIs, including dodecafluoro-1,6-diiodohexane (PFHxDI) and tridecafluorohexyl iodide (PFHxI), were investigated in the neural differentiation of the mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Without influencing the cytobiological process of the mESCs, PFIs interfered the triploblastic development by increasing ectodermal differentiation, thus promoting subsequent neurogenesis. The temporal regulation of PFIs in Notch-Hes signaling through the targeting of mmu-miRNA-34a-5p provided a substantial explanation for the underlying mechanism of PFI-promoted mESC commitment to the neural lineage. The findings herein provided new knowledge on the potential neurodevelopmental toxicities of PFIs, which would help advance the health risk assessment of these kinds of emerging chemicals.","Alkanes,Iodides,MicroRNAs,Iodine","Aptasensors,bisphenols,electrochemical sensors,molecularly imprinted polymers,nanomaterials","Benzhydryl Compounds,Humans,Molecularly Imprinted Polymers,Nanostructures,Phenols"

Mouse dams were orally exposed to relatively low doses of four EDCs: (atrazine (10 mg/kg), bisphenol-A (50 ¬µg/kg), perfluorooctanoic acid (0.1 mg/kg), 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (0.036 ¬µg/kg)), or the combination (MIX), from gestational day 7 until birth or for an equivalent 12 days in non-pregnant females. Glucose intolerance, serum lipids, weight, and visceral adiposity were assessed six months later. MIX-exposed dams exhibited hyperglycemia with a persistent elevation in blood glucose two hours after glucose administration in a glucose tolerance test, whereas no such effects were observed in MIX-exposed non-pregnant females. Correspondingly, MIX dams showed elevated serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL). There were no statistically significant differences in weight or visceral adipose; MIX dams showed an average visceral adipose volume to body volume ratio of 0.09, while the vehicle dams had an average ratio of 0.07. Collectively, these findings provide biological plausibility for the epidemiological associations observed between EDC exposures during pregnancy and subsequent maternal metabolic dyshomeostasis, and proof of concept data that highlight the importance of considering complex EDC mixtures based of off common health outcomes, e.g., for increased risk for later-life maternal metabolic effects following pregnancy.",,"Air pollution,BeWo cell line,Beta human chorionic gonadotropin (Œ≤-hCG),Passive dosing,Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon,Progesterone","Benzo(a)pyrene,Cell Line,Chorionic Gonadotropin,Endocrine Disruptors,Female,Humans,In Vitro Techniques,Placenta,Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons,Pregnancy,Progesterone,Rubber,Silicon"

The present work outlined the subchronic effect of low-dose BPA (10 mg/kg) on histology of spleen, level of hepatic trace metals, and hepatic protein profile of Wistar rats. To conduct the research work, animals were grouped into two categories ( = 5). Group 1 was labelled as the control group and group 2 was taken as an experimental group. Experimental group was exposed to low-dose BPA for 12 weeks. Histopathology of spleen highlighted dilation in splenic sinuses, follicle activation, followed by depopulation in the area of white pulp and red pulp in the experimental group. Iron staining revealed significant hemosiderosis in the experimental group when compared with the control group. Statistically significant decrease was noted in zinc and copper concentrations, while nonsignificant change was observed for magnesium concentration through atomic absorption spectroscopy. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was run for hepatic protein profiling, and as compared to control, elevated levels of different proteins were observed in the experimental group. It can be concluded from the above results that even low dose of BPA causes changes in the major organs of the body. Hence, it is suggested that BPA alternative should be used, so that public health status can be secured.'}","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Metals, Heavy,Phenols,Proteins,bisphenol A","Benzophenone-3,biomarker,oxybenzone,pubertal milestones,sex hormones","Benzophenones,Biomarkers,Child,Dehydroepiandrosterone,Estradiol,Estrone,Female,Gonadal Steroid Hormones,Humans,Longitudinal Studies,Sulfates,Sunscreening Agents,Surveys and Questionnaires,Testosterone"

33771252,-96,,,Flufenoxuron suppresses the proliferation of testicular cells by targeting mitochondria in mice.,"Flufenoxuron is a benzoylurea pesticide that is used to eradicate insects and acarids in the farmland. Even though it specifically works on target animals, the possibilities of its bioaccumulation and harmful effects on non-target animals cannot be denied. As the usage and application of pesticides increases, exposure to them also increases through ingestion of food residues, inhalation, or dermal contact. Pesticides could also be considered as endocrine disruptor chemicals; however, the reproductive toxicity and cellular mechanisms of flufenoxuron have not been identified. Our results indicate that flufenoxuron inhibits cellular proliferation and hampers calcium homeostasis, especially by targeting mitochondria. We also confirmed the induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and ER-mitochondrial contact signaling. Using pharmacological inhibitors, we also observed that the mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt signaling pathways were upregulated by flufenoxuron. Further, by oral administration of flufenoxuron (100¬†mg/kg/bw) to C57BL/6 male mice, we observed transcriptional changes in the testis-related genes. Collectively, we demonstrated that flufenoxuron inhibits cell proliferation and alters gene expression in mouse testis cells and induces testicular dysfunction in mice. These results indicate that flufenoxuron may be harmful to male reproduction and fertility in the early stages of pregnancy.","Phenylurea Compounds,flufenoxuron","female,phthalic acids/urine,pregnancy,questionnaires,racial groups","Beverages,Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Exposure,Environmental Pollutants,Female,Humans,Maternal Exposure,Phthalic Acids,Pregnancy"

34979203,-96,,,Bisphenol S exposure induces intestinal inflammation: An integrated metabolomic and transcriptomic study.,"As a typical substitute for bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol S (BPS) is raising concerns due to the potential adverse effects on human health. Limit evidence is available to understand the toxicity of BPS to the digestive system, especially for intestine. In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential effects and underlying mechanisms of BPS exposure on human colon mucosal epithelial cells (NCM460). Our results showed that BPS exposure significantly increased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-Œ± (TNF-Œ±), interferon-Œ≥ (IFN-Œ≥) and interleukin-17A (IL-17A). The tight junctions of the cells has been destroyed by BPS exposure, which was characterized by a down-regulation of the tight junction proteins (Claudin1 and zonula occluden 1 (ZO1)). A multi-omics study explored the underlying mechanisms based on the metabolomic and transcriptomic responses. A variety of neurotransmitters increased significantly after exposure to BPS. The top enriched pathway was ""glutamatergic synapse"", which was activated by BPS exposure, resulting in the up-regulation of l-glutamine. Links were observed among the altered metabolites, genes and cytokines. Our results indicate that exposure to BPS may disturb the balance of gut-brain axis, leading to the production of inflammatory cytokines and the destruction of tight junction in NCM460¬†cells. It provides new clue for the development of intestinal inflammation in terms of the environmental pollutants.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Environmental Pollutants,Phenols,Sulfones,bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)sulfone",,"Biliary Tract Diseases,Cholangiopancreatography, Endoscopic Retrograde,Chronic Disease,Drainage,Humans,Pancreatic Pseudocyst,Pancreatitis,Postoperative Complications,Tomography, X-Ray Computed,Ultrasonography"

Previous studies have suggested that endocrine disrupting chemicals such as organochlorine pesticides could be a risk factor for endometriosis. Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) is a weak ligand of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and promotes metalloproteinase and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression, as well as, c-Src activation in human endometrial stromal cells (T-HESC) and in rat endometriosis model. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of HCB exposure on oestrogen receptor (ER) …ë and Œ≤, progesterone receptor (PR) and aromatase expression, as well as, on cell migration and invasion in T-HESC and primary cultures of endometrial stromal cells from eutopic endometria of control subjects (ESC). Results show that HCB increases ER…ë and aromatase protein levels and reduces PR content in both T-HESC and ESC. However, the pesticide only increases ERŒ≤ expression in ESC, without changes in T-HESC. Moreover, cell migration and invasion are promoted by pesticide exposure involving the AhR, c-Src, COX-2 and ER pathways in T-HESC. HCB also triggers ER…ë activation via phosphorylation in Y537 through AhR/c-Src pathway.

35324727,-96,,,Transient Post-Natal Exposure to Xenoestrogens Induces Long-Term Alterations in Cardiac Calcium Signaling.,"Today, non-communicable disorders are widespread worldwide. Among them, cardiovascular diseases represent the main cause of death. At the origin of these diseases, exposure to challenges during developmental windows of vulnerability (peri-conception, in utero, and early infancy periods) have been incriminated. Among the challenges that have been described, endocrine disruptors are of high concern because of their omnipresence in the environment. Worrisomely, since birth, children are exposed to a significant number of endocrine disruptors. However, the role of such early exposure on long-term cardiac health is poorly described. In this context, based on a model of rats exposed postnatally and transiently to an estrogenic compound prototype (estradiol benzoate, EB), we aimed to delineate the effects on the adult heart of such transient early exposure to endocrine disruptors and identify the underlying mechanisms involved in the potential pathogenesis. We found that this transient post-natal exposure to EB induced cardiac hypertrophy in adulthood, with increased cardiomyocyte size. The evaluation of cardiac calcium signaling, through immunoblot approaches, highlighted decreased expression of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2 (SERCA2) and decreased Nuclear Factor of Activated T Cells (NFAT3) phosphorylation as a potential underlying mechanism of cardiac hypertrophy. Furthermore, the treatment of cardiomyocytes with EB in vitro induced a decrease in SERCA2 protein levels. Overall, our study demonstrates that early transient exposure to EB induces permanent cardiac alterations. Together, our data highlight SERCA2 down-regulation as a potential mechanism involved in the cardiac pathogenesis induced by EB. These results suggest programming of adult heart dysfunctions such as arrhythmia and heart failures by early exposure to endocrine disruptors and could open new perspectives for treatment and prevention.",,"Interaction,Molecular docking,Organic pollutants,Protein,Spectroscopic methods","Binding Sites,Crystallography,Environmental Pollutants,Humans,Molecular Docking Simulation,Protein Binding,Spectrometry, Fluorescence,Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet,Thermodynamics"

The current study aimed to investigate the potential toxic effect of ATZ as a neuroendocrine disruptor on the cerebellum and thyroid gland and on the liver as a detoxifying organ. We examined the ability of ATZ to induce oxidative stress and subsequent apoptosis in these organs. Moreover, we investigated the potential protective effect of Acacia nilotica, because of its potent antioxidant activity. Thus, our study was carried out on 40 adult male albino rats that were divided equally into 4 groups (10 rats/each group). The first group received distilled water, while the second group received ATZ dissolved in corn oil at 200 mg/kg body weight/day by stomach gavage. The third group was treated orally by ATZ (200 mg/kg body weight/day) plus Acacia nilotica (400 mg/kg/day). Group IV received Acacia nilotica only at a dose (400 mg/kg/day). After successive 30 days of the experiment, blood and tissue samples were collected from all groups. Our findings revealed the ability of ATZ to induce toxic effects was observed microscopically in the form of degenerated neurons and vacuolated neuropil of the cerebellum, degenerated hepatocytes, and vacuolation of the follicular cells of the thyroid gland. Furthermore, ATZ significantly elevated AST, ALT, and ALP serum levels and TB concentration, while decreased GSH. DNA fragmentation% and activated caspase-3 expression significantly increased after ATZ exposure. Interestingly, Acacia nilotica administration was able to partially protect the examined organs against the toxic effect of ATZ exposure.","Atrazine,Antioxidants","ERŒ±,docking,endocrine disrupting chemicals,nuclear receptors,pharmacophores,virtual screening","Binding Sites,Databases, Chemical,Datasets as Topic,Endocrine Disruptors,Estrogen Receptor alpha,Humans,Ligands,Molecular Docking Simulation,Protein Binding,Research Design,Sensitivity and Specificity,Structure-Activity Relationship,United States,United States Environmental Protection Agency"
33129825,-96,,,Inorganic arsenic and its methylated metabolites as endocrine disruptors in the placenta: Mechanisms underpinning glucocorticoid receptor (GR) pathway perturbations.,"Exposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs) is a significant public health concern with individuals around the globe exposed to harmful levels through contaminated drinking water. Exposure to iAs during pregnancy is of particular concern and has been associated with pregnancy complications and adverse child health later in life. Effects of in utero exposure may be mediated through alterations in key signaling pathways in the placenta that regulate fetal growth and development. A pathway of interest is the glucocorticoid receptor (GR)- signaling pathway, which is known to regulate fetal and placental development. While prior research has shown that iAs alters GR-associated gene expression in trophoblasts, the mechanisms that underlie these perturbations remain unknown. In the present study, we set out to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underpin observed alterations in GR-associated gene expression. We also aimed to determine whether the methylated metabolites of iAs, namely monomethyl‚Äëarsenic (MMA) and dimethyl‚Äëarsenic (DMA), also influence GR-associated signaling in the placenta. The data indicate that iAs alters GR activation in a dose-dependent manner, reduces nuclear translocation, and reduces DNA binding. Additionally, the results demonstrate that MMA and DMA alter the expression of eight GR-associated genes, modulate GR activation, and alter DNA binding. These data are significant as they highlight the role of iAs as an endocrine disruptor and for the first time explore the effects of MMA and DMA on endocrine signaling in the placenta.","Arsenicals,Drinking Water,Endocrine Disruptors,Receptors, Glucocorticoid,dimethylarsine,Arsenic","Bisphenol compounds,Computational simulation,Spectroscopy,Transthyretin","Binding Sites,Hydrogen Bonding,Molecular Docking Simulation,Molecular Dynamics Simulation,Prealbumin,Protein Binding,Spectrometry, Fluorescence,Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared,Thermodynamics"

Reproductive toxicity of phthalate esters (PEs) occurs in rat offspring exposed in utero, a phenomenon that is better studied in male offspring than females. The current study reports female reproductive tract malformations in the Sprague-Dawley rat similar to those characteristic of MRKH syndrome, following in utero exposure to a mixture of 5 PEs. We determined that females are 2-fold less sensitive to the effects of the 5-PE mixture than males for reproductive tract malformations. We were not fully successful in defining the critical exposure period for females; however, incidence of malformations was 88% following dosing from GD8 to 19 versus 22% and 0% for GD8-13 and GD14-19, respectively. Overall, this study provides valuable information regarding female vulnerability to in utero phthalate exposure and further characterizes a potential model for the human MRKH syndrome.","Endocrine Disruptors,Phthalic Acids,Plasticizers",,"Biocatalysis,Biodegradation, Environmental,Environmental Pollutants,Flame Retardants,Hydrolysis,Kinetics,Organophosphates,Phosphoric Triester Hydrolases,Sphingomonadaceae,Stereoisomerism,Substrate Specificity"

Studies showed that TBBPA affects oxidative stress, cell proliferation and intracellular calcium levels. However, the vascular consequences of TBBPA exposure are still relatively unexplored. Hence, this work aimed to analyse TBBPA effects on rat aortic smooth muscle and its action mechanisms. Through an ex vivo approach, Wistar rat aortas were used in an organ bath to evaluate the vascular effect of TBBPA (0.01-100 ŒºM). Additionally, TBBPA's mode of action was studied through calcium and potassium channel inhibitors.

32526583,-95,,,The sex-specific association of phthalate exposure with DNA methylation and characteristics of body fat in children.,"The present study assessed the association between phthalate exposure and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymerase Œ≥ (POLG) methylation along with the potential effect on the characteristics of body fat in children. A total of 152 children were enrolled. The urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites were measured using ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Genomic DNA was extracted from the buffy coat, and bisulfite-treated DNA was subjected to a pyrosequencing assay. In total, 17 CpG sites in the exon 2 region of POLG were included in the analysis. A multivariable regression model was applied to determine whether characteristics of body fat were associated with phthalate exposure and methylation of POLG. After adjustment for covariates, male children with a ten-fold increase in mono-methyl phthalate (MMP) or mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP) concentrations had significantly higher measurements for total body fat (MMP: Œ≤¬†=¬†6.47%; MBzP: Œ≤¬†=¬†3.54%), and trunk fat (MMP: Œ≤¬†=¬†6.67%; MBzP: Œ≤¬†=¬†3.90%). Male children who had hypermethylation at the 2nd CpG site in exon 2 of POLG also had high measurements for BMI (Œ≤¬†=¬†1.66¬†kg/m2), waist (Œ≤¬†=¬†4.49¬†cm) and hip (Œ≤¬†=¬†4.81¬†cm) circumference, total body fat (Œ≤¬†=¬†5.48%), and trunk fat (Œ≤¬†=¬†6.21%). A dose-response relationship existed between methylation at the 2nd CpG site in exon 2 of POLG and characteristics of body fat (p for trend<0.01). This study suggested that male children who are exposed to phthalic acid esters have high body weight, BMI, and body and trunk fat percentages. Methylation of the exon 2 region of POLG is a possible mechanism behind the causal effect of endocrine-disrupting substances.","Environmental Pollutants,Phthalic Acids,phthalic acid","4-Nonylphenol,Biosolids,Blue-green algae (Spirulina platensis)-derived biochar,Sodium sulfite","Biodegradation, Environmental,Charcoal,Microalgae,Microbiota,Sewage,Spirulina,Sulfites"
32696725,-95,,,Investigation of the effects of bisphenol-A exposure on lymphoid system in prenatal stage.,"Bisphenol-A (BPA) used in the production of plastic materials is a temperature-soluble agent. It also has a steroid hormone-like activity; therefore, it poses a danger to human health. In our study, we aimed to investigate the effects of BPA on lymph node and spleen in male rats exposed to this agent during prenatal stage. The pregnant female rats were divided into four groups: control, sham, low dose (300 ¬µg/kg BPA), and high dose (900 ¬µg/kg BPA). BPA was dissolved in 1 mL of corn oil and administered to the pregnant rats every day during pregnancy. On the 21st and 45th day after the birth, male rats' lymph node and spleen samples were taken and histopathological examination was performed. Samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin to determine the general histological appearance, and with CD3 and CD20 immunohistochemically. The results of staining were evaluated by H-score, and statistical analysis was performed. In the samples, BPA applications were not found to cause significant tissue damage. But there was a significant decrease in the immunoreactivities of CD3 and CD20 after BPA applications in both 21st and 45th day samples. After high dose BPA administration, decreased CD3 immunoreactivity was statistically significant. It is thought that BPA does not cause histologically significant tissue damage, but it may impair organ function at cellular level. The investigation of molecules involved in organ function will be useful in revealing the mechanisms that will cause dysfunction.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Phenols,bisphenol A","17Œ±-ethinylestradiol,Humic acids,Photo-bioelectrochemical treatment,Reactive species,Water purification","Biodegradation, Environmental,Humic Substances,Hydrogen Peroxide,Oxidation-Reduction,Water Pollutants, Chemical,Water Purification"

Our recent studies demonstrated that NP exposure is related to colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. In this study, we also found epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) promoted by NP treatment in CRC cells. However, the mechanism of NP on tumor metastasis is still unclear. In this study, we focused on the effect of the regulator of cell cycle (RGCC) induced by NP treatment. The cancer genome atlas (TCGA) analysis suggested that the expression of RGCC increased in CRC tissues, and our clinical samples showed that the expression of RGCC in tumor tissues is positively correlated with the serum level of NP in CRC patients. Further studies revealed that overexpression of RGCC could enhance the NP-induced EMT process in CRC cells and activate ERK signaling pathways. Inhibiting ERK signaling by ERK inhibitors or the knockdown of RGCC could attenuate the NP-induced EMT process. In addition, both RGCC overexpression and NP treatment could activate ERK pathways and attenuate the effect of ERK inhibitors on the EMT process in CRC cells. Altogether, this study demonstrated that NP could induce cell invasion and migration by increasing the expression of RGCC to enhance the EMT process, which might be through the activation of ERK signaling pathways. This finding supported a potential target for studying NP exposure-related colorectal cancers.","Phenols,nonylphenol","anti-biofilm,endocrine disruptor assessment,gallic acid,marine bacteria,safer chemicals","Biofilms,Biofouling,Disinfectants"

But there is limited research on the childhood dyslipidemia. Our cohort study was conducted in Xiamen city, Fujian Province, China. A total of 829 children (mean age 8.5 years) were included with collection of urine, blood samples and demographic data in May 2018 and followed up once a year from 2018 to 2020. We performed adjusted log-binomial regressions to examine associations between sex-specific tertiles of seven phthalate metabolites and dyslipidemia in visit 1, as well as persistent dyslipidemia and occasional dyslipidemia. We also used generalized estimating equation models (GEE) to explore the relationships between log-transformed phthalate metabolites and lipid profiles. In adjusted models, the prevalence and RRs of dyslipidemia increased with tertile group of mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP), mono-2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl phthalate (MEOHP), mono-2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl phthalate (MEHHP), and summed di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (‚àëDEHP) metabolites with a dose-response relationship in visit 1, as well as persistent dyslipidemia. Higher MnBP, ‚àëLMWP, MEHHP, MEOHP, and ‚àëDEHP concentrations were also associated with higher levels of log-transformed triglycerides (TG). Boys were more vulnerable to phthalates exposure than girls. In conclusion, children in China were widely exposed to phthalates, and phthalates exposure during childhood might significantly increase the risk of dyslipidemia and a higher level of lipid profiles, particularly in boys.","Environmental Pollutants,Phthalic Acids,phthalic acid","17Œ±-ethinylestradiol,Biofilter,Biogenic manganese oxide,Mn-oxidizing bacteria,Pseudomonas putidaMnB1","Biofilms,Ethinyl Estradiol,Manganese Compounds,Oxides,Pseudomonas putida,Water Purification"

It is also an endocrine disruptor and is thought to be related to abnormalities of the reproductive tract. However, its mechanism of inducing abnormalities of the male reproductive tract is still unclear. The purpose of this study was to study the effect of gestational vinclozolin exposure on the development of rat fetal Leydig cells. Female pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to vinclozolin (0, 25, 50, and 100¬†mg/kg body weight/day) by gavage from gestational day 14-21. Vinclozolin dose-dependently reduced serum testosterone levels at doses of 50 and 100¬†mg/kg and the anogenital distance at 100¬†mg/kg. RNA-seq, qPCR, and Western blotting showed that vinclozolin down-regulated the expression of Nr5a1, Sox9, Lhcgr, Cyp11a1, Hsd3b1, Hsd17b3, Amh, Pdgfa, and Dhh and their encoded proteins. Vinclozolin reduced the number of NR2F2-positive stem Leydig cells at a dose of 100¬†mg/kg and enhanced autophagy in the testes. In conclusion, vinclozolin disrupts reproductive tract development and testis development in male fetal rats via several pathways.","Endocrine Disruptors,Fungicides, Industrial,Oxazoles,Testosterone,vinclozolin","Endocrine disrupting chemicals,Estrogen receptor alpha,Fluorescent reporter platform,Point-of-departure modelling,Single cell live cell imaging","Biological Assay,Cell Line,Endocrine Disruptors,Estrogen Receptor alpha,Estrogens,Humans,Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development"

In this study, rats were divided into three groups of twelve animals each and were administered with Bisphenol-A by oral gavage with levels of 0, 50 and, 100 Œºg. Half of the animals in each group were fed with feed which contained 3% turmeric (wt/wt), for a period of 4 wk, while the rest of the rats received the same diet treatment without the addition of turmeric. At the end of the experiment, all rats were terminated and the internal organs such as liver, kidney, femurs were collected and analyzed. Mean and SD values were compared by one-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis-Wilcoxon test, the formation of micronuclei was compared using Mann-Whitney U-test. Significant decrease in serum malondialdehyde and urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine levels were observed in Bisphenol-A+turmeric groups as compared to Bisphenol-A groups. Bisphenol-A groups exhibited significantly higher mean levels of DNA damage in liver and kidney as compared to the untreated control group.

35427876,-95,,,Perfluorooctanoic acid exposure increases both proliferation and apoptosis of human placental trophoblast cells mediated by ER stress-induced ROS or UPR pathways.,"Perfluorooctanoate acid (PFOA) is a highly persistent and widespread chemical in the environment. PFOA serum levels in pregnant women are positively associated with an increased risk of placenta-related disorders. However, the mechanism of PFOA cytotoxicity involved in placental cells and cellular responses such as ER stress remains poorly understood. In this study, we studied the cellular toxicity of PFOA with a focus on proliferation and apoptosis in a human placental trophoblast cell line. Cell viability, number, apoptosis, stress response, activation of the involved signaling pathways were assessed. Our results showed PFOA affected cell viability, proliferation and also resulted in apoptosis. Besides, both pro-proliferation and pro-apoptosis effects were attenuated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inhibitors. Further experiments demonstrated that two different signaling pathways were activated by PFOA-induced ER stress and involved in PFOA toxicity: the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent ERK signaling triggered trophoblast proliferation, while the ATF4-dependent C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) signaling was the trigger of apoptosis. We conclude that PFOA-induced ER stress is the trigger of proliferation and apoptosis of trophoblast via ROS or UPR signaling pathway, which leads to the altered balance critical to the normal development and function of the placenta.","Caprylates,Fluorocarbons,Reactive Oxygen Species,perfluorooctanoic acid",,"Biological Assay,Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Monitoring,Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay,Estrogens,Genes, Reporter,Recombinant Proteins,Toxicity Tests,Waste Disposal, Fluid,Water Pollutants, Chemical"

As a substitute of bisphenol A (BPA), BPF is widely used in various consumer products, leading to an increased risk of people's exposure. However, there are few studies on the immunotoxicity and mechanism of BPF. This study aimed to investigate the effect of BPF on the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by macrophages and explore its mechanism. In our study, RAW264.7 macrophages were treated with different concentrations of BPF (0, 5, 10 and 20 ŒºM) for 24 h. The results showed that the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-Œ± and IL-1Œ≤) and the production of lactate were increased in a dose-dependent manner. BPFalso led to the activation of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. After pretreatment with glycolysis inhibitor (2-DG) and exposure to BPF (20 ŒºM), the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by BPF was inhibited. PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) and estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist (ICI 182,780) could also inhibit the above effects induced by BPF (20 ŒºM). In conclusion, our results suggested that BPF can enhance glycolysis through ER mediated PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, and the enhanced glycolysis further promoted the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

However, there are few studies on the reproductive toxicity of Phe in mammals. In this study, male Kunming mice were gavaged once every two days with Phe (5, 50, and 500¬†ng/kg) for 28 weeks. The accumulation levels of Phe in the testis were dose-dependently increased. Histopathological staining showed that Phe exposure reduced the number of spermatogonia, sperm and Sertoli cells. The percentage of testicular apoptotic cells was significantly increased, which was further verified by the upregulated BAX protein. The expression of the GDNF/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was downregulated, which might suppress the self-renewal and differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells. Meanwhile, Phe exposure inhibited the expression of Sertoli cell markers (Fshr, WT1, Sox9) and the Leydig cell marker Cyp11a1, indicating damage to the function of Sertoli cells and Leydig cells. Serum estrogen and testicular estrogen receptor alpha were significantly upregulated, while androgen receptor expression was downregulated. These alterations might be responsible for impaired spermatogenesis.

The results showed that pubertal BPA exposure decreased social play between adolescent males and sociability of adolescent males. Further, pubertal BPA exposure reduced sociability and inhibited social novel preferences of adult males. BPA inhibited social interactions with opposite sex but improved socio-sexual exploration and the low-intensity mating behavior (mounting) with same sex in adult males. In residential-intruder test, BPA-exposed adult males showed a decrease in aggressiveness and an enhancement in prosocial behavior with intruder. Western blot analysis showed that BPA (especially at 4\xa0mg/kg/d) down-regulated the levels of AR in the amygdala and the striatum but up-regulated the levels of DR1 and DAT proteins in the striatum of adult males. BPA at 4\xa0mg\xa0kg decreased the levels of T in the serum and the brain. These results suggest that pubertal BPA exposure affects social play and sociability of adolescent males and even results in long-term effects on social behavior of adult males.

In this study, rats were exposed to gradient concentrations of DMP through intragastric administration to assess the blood immunotoxic effects in the combined assay of biomarker, cytometry, and transcriptomics. DMP treatment altered the redox status of rats, thus causing oxidative damage. Significantly decreased blood cell counts and disordered antibody and cytokine secretion were observed in treated rats, suggesting the suppressed immune defense and destructed inflammatory regulation. Flow cytometry showed that in lymphocytes, especially CD3CD4 T cells, the occurrence of apoptosis/necrosis was positively related to DMP exposure level. Transcriptomics revealed an oxidative stress-related mechanism. The overexpression of the Bcl-2 family genes and the activation of the Fas/FasL pathway triggered downstream caspase cascade and caused reactive oxygen species signaling-mediated apoptosis/necrosis.

35951760,-95,,,Exposure to the Organophosphate Pesticide Fenitrothion Directly Induced Defects in Mouse Embryonic External Genitalia.,"Many industrial chemicals have been reported as antiandrogenic substances. Exposure to these substances represents a potential risk to human health, particularly to the development of reproductive organs such as embryonic external genitalia (eExG). Currently, there is a need for more assay systems that can elucidate the toxicological actions and mechanisms of endocrine-disrupting chemicals. In this study, we show that the eExG slice culture assay is useful for the evaluation of the differing modes of action of endocrine-disrupting chemicals on urethra formation. We assessed the possible endocrine-disrupting activity of 3 chemicals with reported antiandrogenic function, diazinon, dibutyl phthalate, and fenitrothion (FNT) on eExG slices. Exposure to FNT, but not diazinon and dibutyl phthalate, induced defects of androgen-induced urethral masculinization and reduced expression of the androgen-target gene Mafb. Live imaging analyses showed that FNT treatment inhibited androgen-dependent MAFB induction within 12‚Äâh. Furthermore, FNT-treated tissue slices showed reduced expression of the androgen receptor. These results indicate that FNT disrupts androgen signaling by reduction of androgen receptor expression during androgen-induced eExG masculinization. This study thus highlights the importance of animal models, which allow for the effective assessment of tissue-specific endocrine-disrupting activity to further reveal the etiology of chemical-induced congenital anomalies.","Receptors, Androgen,Fenitrothion,Androgens,Dibutyl Phthalate,Insecticides","biomonitoring,children,exposure,metabolite,nonylphenol,urine","Biomarkers,Child,Environmental Exposure,Humans,Indonesia,Phenols,Saudi Arabia,Thailand"

However, it is still controversial and attracting extensive public concern that whether PFASs can affect the human fertility potential. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the associations of women's exposure to PFASs with pregnancy loss, the relevant processes of fertilization, zygote implantation, and embryo development by using a prospective cohort study. The women undergoing in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) treatment were recruited in Beijing City (Beijing Center) and Yantai City (Yantai Center) in China during 2015-2017. A total of 305 women were recruited before the IVF-ET treatment. Twelve PFASs were measured in their serum samples collected in the day before the IVF-ET treatment, as well as in the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) day. The three IVF-ET outcomes were included, i.e. hCG test negative, clinical pregnancy failure (CPF), and preclinical spontaneous abortion. Nine serum PFASs had detection rate of >70% in Beijing and Yantai centers. The exposure patterns to PFASs between these two centers were overall different. For Beijing Center, we only found a positive association of perflurodecanoic acid (PFDA) with the risk of CPF [RR¬†=¬†2.28 (95¬†%CI: 1.02-5.11)], but there is a reverse trend in Yantai Center with [RR¬†=¬†0.45 (95¬†%CI: 0.23-0.85)]. However, the serum concentration of PFDA in Beijing Center was relatively lower than that of Yantai Center. Other significant associations of the detected PFASs with the IVF-ET outcomes, or with the relevant clinical processes, were not found. The multi-pollutant regression model of the Bayesian kernel machine regression suggested that there were no joint effects between various PFASs on the concerned outcomes. Overall, we suggest that most PFAS were not associated with early pregnancy loss at the current exposure levels.

Perinatal and developmental exposure to BPA has been known to cause hepatotoxicity in adulthood. However, its intergenerational effects in a metabolically challenged population have been scarcely investigated. Our study was designed to assess the intergenerational effect of an environmentally relevant dose of BPA and diet-induced parental obesity on the hepatic health outcome of F1 offspring. Wistar rats were given a high-fat diet to induce obesity, followed by chronic low dosages of BPA (10 ppm √ó 180 days) in drinking water. Post-treatment, rats were crossed within groups to obtain the F1 generation. Weanling pups were observed for weight gain, levels of hepatic antioxidants, liver function enzymes, cholesterol, C-reactive protein, and triglyceride in the serum. Histological changes in the liver tissue were also investigated. mRNA expression of energy homeostasis genes (FTO and MCR-4) in the liver was analyzed alongside blood biomarkers. We observed higher birth weight and rapid weight gain in the test group in comparison with controls, which was consistent with the changes in mRNA and protein expression of¬†FTO and MCR-4.

Thus, chemicals that can affect thyroid hormone signaling during pregnancy are of great concern. Perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) is a widespread environmental contaminant found in human serum, breastmilk, and other tissues, capable of lowering serum thyroxine (T4) in rats. Here, we investigated its effects on the thyroid system and neurodevelopment following maternal exposure from early gestation through lactation (0.05, 5 or 25‚Äâmg/kg/day PFHxS), alone or in combination with a mixture of 12 environmentally relevant endocrine disrupting compounds (EDmix). PFHxS lowered thyroid hormone levels in both dams and offspring in a dose-dependent manner, but did not change TSH levels, weight, histology, or expression of marker genes of the thyroid gland. No evidence of thyroid hormone-mediated neurobehavioral disruption in offspring was observed. Since human brain development appear very sensitive to low T4 levels, we maintain that PFHxS is of potential concern to human health. It is our view that current rodent models are not sufficiently sensitive to detect adverse neurodevelopmental effects of maternal and perinatal hypothyroxinemia and that we need to develop more sensitive brain-based markers or measurable metrics of thyroid hormone-dependent perturbations in brain development.","Endocrine Disruptors,Fluorocarbons,Sulfonic Acids,Thyroid Hormones,perfluorohexanesulfonic acid,Thyrotropin,Thyroxine","College students,Diphenyl phosphate,Magnetic molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction,Organophosphate esters,Urine samples","Biphenyl Compounds,Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid,Flame Retardants,Humans,Magnetic Phenomena,Organophosphates,Phosphates,Reproducibility of Results,Solid Phase Extraction,Students,Tandem Mass Spectrometry"

Here we describe that the MG involution process in female gerbil mothers is delayed by bisphenol A (BPA) exposure during gestation and lactation. The process is directly influenced by changes in expression of extracellular matrix proteases MMP-2, MMP-9, and FAP, and the incidence of collagen and elastin is reduced after 7 and 14 days of weaning. A pro-inflammatory environment in the late involution process was confirmed by higher expression of TNF-Œ±, COX-2 and phospho-STAT3 n the MG stroma, allied to increases in the incidence of macrophages and mast cells. These aspects impacted the proliferative pattern of epithelial cells, which decreased on the 14th post-weaning day.

31812737,-94,,,Bisphenol A and several derivatives exert neural toxicity in human neuron-like cells by decreasing neurite length.,"Bisphenol A (BPA) and its derivatives, including bisphenols S (BPS), F (BPF), E (BPE), B (BPB), Z (BPZ), and AF (BPAF), are widely used in consumer products. Moreover, they are typically detected in the environment, food, and humans. Previous studies have linked BPA to several health risks, but it is still unclear whether BPA replacements are safe. In this study, we developed an in vitro model based on human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to explore the potential neural toxicity of these compounds. We observed that the bisphenols affected the viability of hESCs and hESC-derived neural stem cells (NSCs) at high concentrations, with BPS being the least cytotoxic and BPAF the strongest cytotoxic compound. At human-relevant concentrations, the bisphenols did not significantly interfere with gene expression and protein levels during hESC differentiation into the neural epithelium, as well as during specification of neuron-like cells from NSCs. Nevertheless, monitoring of cell morphology changes indicated that exposure to BPA and its derivatives impaired neurite length in neuron-like cells. Thus, our findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of bisphenol-dependent neurotoxicity at low nanomolar levels and support the view that BPA substitutes may not be sufficiently safe for widespread use as industrial chemicals.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Phenols,bisphenol A","Asthma,Asthma disparities,Endocrine-disrupting compounds,Personal care products","Black or African American,Asthma,Cosmetics,Endocrine Disruptors,Humans,Parabens"
9652547,-94,,,Endocrine mechanisms underlying the growth effects of developmental lead exposure in the rat.,"A dose-response study was conducted to examine the growth suppression associated with developmental lead exposure in a rat model and to determine the endocrine mechanisms underlying these effects. Ad libitum intake of lead acetate (0.05% to 0.45% w/v) was initiated in time-impregnated female Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 10-15/group) at gestational day 5. At birth, pups were culled to four male and four females per litter. Lead exposure of dams continued until weaning, following which lead exposure of pups was continued until sacrifice at age 2 , 35, 55, and 85 days. Birth weight and prepubertal and pubertal growth rates were significantly suppressed. Growth rates were suppressed to a much greater degree in male as compared to female pups. Decreased growth rates were accompanied by a significant decrease in plasma insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) concentrations and (1) a significant increase in pituitary growth hormone (GH) content during puberty in pups of both sexes, (2) a delay in the developmental profiles of the GH-dependent male-specific liver enzymes cytochrome P-450 CYP2C11 and N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene sulfotransferase, and (3) continued suppression of these enzymes in lead-exposed adult male pups. In addition, significant decreases in plasma sex steroids, testosterone (male) and 17beta-estradiol (female), were observed during puberty. Postpuberty, at age 85 d, both IGF1 and sex steroid levels were indistinguishable from control pups despite continued lead exposure. Growth rates were also similar in control and lead-exposed pups between age 57 and 85 d. Data suggest that the mechanism underlying lead-induced sex-independent suppression of growth observed in these studies involves disruption of GH secretion during puberty. It is possible that the mechanisms underlying the greater suppression of somatic growth observed at puberty in lead-exposed male offspring may be due to the additional hypoandrogenization produced by the action of lead on the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis.","Lead,Growth Hormone","Black,Latina,endocrine disruptors,hairdressers,occupational exposure,personal care products,phthalates,women","Black or African American,Brazil,Environmental Exposure,Female,Hispanic or Latino,Humans,Maryland,Occupational Exposure,Phthalic Acids,Pilot Projects,Washington"
35622681,-94,,,Individual and Combined Effects of Paternal Deprivation and Developmental Exposure to Firemaster 550 on Socio-Emotional Behavior in Prairie Voles.,"The prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) is rapidly rising, suggesting a confluence of environmental factors that are likely contributing, including developmental exposure to environmental contaminants. Unfortunately, chemical exposures and social stressors frequently occur simultaneously in many communities, yet very few studies have sought to establish the combined effects on neurodevelopment or behavior. Social deficits are common to many NDDs, and we and others have shown that exposure to the chemical flame retardant mixture, Firemaster 550 (FM 550), or paternal deprivation impairs social behavior and neural function. Here, we used a spontaneously prosocial animal model, the prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster), to explore the effects of perinatal chemical (FM 550) exposure alone or in combination with an early life stressor (paternal absence) on prosocial behavior. Dams were exposed to vehicle (sesame oil) or 1000 ¬µg FM 550 orally via food treats from conception through weaning and the paternal absence groups were generated by removing the sires the day after birth. Adult offspring of both sexes were then subjected to open-field, sociability, and a partner preference test. Paternal deprivation (PD)-related effects included increased anxiety, decreased sociability, and impaired pair-bonding in both sexes. FM 550 effects include heightened anxiety and partner preference in females but reduced partner preference in males. The combination of FM 550 exposure and PD did not exacerbate any behaviors in either sex except for distance traveled by females in the partner preference test and, to a lesser extent, time spent with, and the number of visits to the non-social stimulus by males in the sociability test. FM 550 ameliorated the impacts of parental deprivation on partner preference behaviors in both sexes. This study is significant because it provides evidence that chemical and social stressors can have unique behavioral effects that differ by sex but may not produce worse outcomes in combination.",,"CMV,COVID-19,Infection,Inflammation,Influenza A,Insulin,Insulin resistance,LCMV,Obesity,Type 2 diabetes mellitus","Blood Glucose,Endocrine System,Humans,Infections"

Here, we have used T cell receptor sequencing to analyse the clonal relationship of major CD4 T cell subsets in three patients and three healthy controls. The naive regulatory T cells showed little overlap with helper T cell subsets, supporting divergence in the thymus. The activated/memory regulatory T cell subset displayed more sharing with helper T cells, but was mainly recruited from the naive regulatory T cell population. These clonal patterns were very similar in both patients and controls. However, naive regulatory T cells isolated from the patients had a significantly longer T cell receptor complementarity-determining region 3 than any other population, suggesting failure of thymic selection. These data indicate that the peripheral differentiation of regulatory T cells in APS-1 patients is not different from that in healthy controls.

They have been detected widely in sediment, river, and soil samples, but their environmental risks are largely unknown. Therefore, seven common PHCZs were tested for their endocrine disrupting potential in silico, in vitro, and in vivo. A dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was used to detect receptor-mediated (agonist or antagonistic) activity (concentration range: 10-10 M) against the estrogen receptor Œ± (ERŒ±), glucocorticoid receptor Œ± (GRŒ±), and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). The alterations in the steroidogenesis pathway were investigated in H295R cells. Antagonistic effects against GRŒ± were observed with five PHCZs, along with an increase in the cortisol levels of H295R cells. The most common effect observed was that of the agonistic activity of ERŒ±, with the molecular docking analysis further indicating that hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions may stabilize the interaction between PHCZs and the estrogen receptor binding pocket. In addition, a seven-day exposure of young female rats to three PHCZs (27-BCZ, 3-BCZ, and 36-BCZ) resulted in changes in serum E2 levels, uterine epithelium cell heights, and relative uterus weights.

Prenatal exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in women has been linked to pregnancy disorders and adverse birth outcomes, but no data are available on the relationship between PFAS exposure during pregnancy and postpartum haemorrhage. This study aimed to explore the associations of maternal PFAS exposure with the postpartum haemorrhage risk and total blood loss. A total of 1496 mother-infant pairs in the Guangxi Zhuang birth cohort were included between June 2015 and May 2018. The concentration of PFASs in serum was detected using ultrahigh liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Multiple binomial regression and linear regression models were used to analyse individual PFAS exposures. The mixture of PFASs was analysed using Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR). In single substance exposure models, exposure to perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) increased the risk of postpartum haemorrhage (OR: 3.42, 95¬†% CI: 1.45, 8.07), while exposure to perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoA) was inversely associated with the risk of postpartum haemorrhage (OR: 0.42, 95¬†% CI: 0.22, 0.80).

It was found that higher urinary BPA levels are more likely to be associated with coronary artery disease (CVD). In recent years, the increasing incidence of CVD among young people is observed, which may be related with inflammation rather than the traditional triple-H risk factors. BPA is an endocrine-disrupting chemical, and can induce oxidative stress and chronic inflammation since its estrogenic effect. Inflammatory responses could come from the stimulation of IŒ∫B kinases (IKKs) by estrogen receptors (ERs). Therefore, this study investigated the association of BPA exposure with the gene expression of pro-inflammatory response (ERs and IKKs), an inflammation biomarker of CVD (C-reactive protein, CRP), and physiologic index potency of CVD development symptoms in young adults. This study divided BPA exposure levels into high and low groups based on the median plasma BPA level (4.34 ng/mL), and found that the high BPA group obviously had higher BMI, blood pressure, plasma CRP levels, and gene expression of ERŒ≤ and IKKŒ≤. BMI and gene expression of IKKŒ≤ were also positively correlated with plasma CRP secretion. Furthermore, the study subjects with potential CVD development symptoms had the increased levels of BPA (OR 2.10, 95% CI 0.83-5.39), CRP (OR 2.61, 95% CI 1.03-10.6) and IKKŒ≤ (OR 4.29, 95% CI 1.51-15.6).

In the animals with spermatogenic disturbance, we observed either seminiferous tubules containing only cells with Sertoli cell features (likely Sertoli cell syndrome), or tubule cells in maturation arrest that contained only spermatogonia and/or spermatocytes. Following neonatal DES exposure, 5-week-old mice exhibited inflammation in cauda epididymis; by 8weeks, the inflammation had spread to all segments of epididymis but not the testis; by 12weeks, inflammation of the epididymis was observed in all mice. These data indicated that cauda epididymis has increased sensitivity to neonatal DES exposure compared to other segments of epididymis and testis.

33387882,-92,,,Effects of organochlorine exposure on male reproductive disorders in an electronic waste area of South China.,"Several studies suggest that organochlorine exposure can affect male reproductive functions, causing poor semen quality, endocrine disruption, or dysregulation of thyroid hormones. This study uses multiple linear regression (MLR) models to analyze the correlation between male reproductive functions and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs) congeners or p,p'-DDE levels in serum, semen, and indoor dust samples. Multiple comparisons were all adjusted using the false discovery rate (FDR). The results revealed that the PCB congener levels in seminal plasma were significantly associated with the quality parameters of human semen (i.e., sperm count, morphology, and motility) and thyroid hormones after adjusting for covariates, e.g., associations of the sperm concentration with levels of CB105 (Œ≤¬†=¬†-0.323, 95% CI: -0.561, -0.085, p¬†=¬†0.009), CB44 (Œ≤¬†=¬†0.585, 95% CI: 0.290, 0.880, p < 0.001), and CB66 (Œ≤ = -0.435, 95% CI: -0.728, -0.143, p = 0.004) in the seminal plasma were observed. Correlations between serum pollutants levels and the semen quality, reproductive hormones, or thyroid hormones were also observed. Moreover, our results demonstrate that the quantification of PCBs in seminal plasma can better describe male reproductive disorders than that in serum or dust. Organochlorine exposure measured in serum or dust, especially in seminal plasma, was associated with semen quality, as well as reproductive and thyroid hormones, thus suggesting that the impacts of persistent pollutants on male reproductive health require further investigation.","Environmental Pollutants,Dichlorodiphenyl Dichloroethylene,Polychlorinated Biphenyls","Breast cancer,Mortality,Organochlorine compounds,PCBs,Survival","Breast Neoplasms,Environmental Pollutants,Female,Humans,Kaplan-Meier Estimate,Middle Aged,North Carolina,Polychlorinated Biphenyls,Proportional Hazards Models"

To characterize StAR expression during apoptosis, mouse MA-10 Leydig tumor cells were treated with ethane dimethane sulfonate (EDS), an inducer of apoptosis, and the metal ion chelator NNN'N'-tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN), an inducer of cell death. Both chemicals induced cell death and similarly inhibited dbcAMP-stimulated steroidogenesis and accumulation of the 30 kDa form of StAR. Utilizing the dye JC-1, it was found that TPEN and EDS also impaired the mitochondrial electrochemical potential (delta psi). In Sertoli cells, which also express StAR, EDS induced cell death and attenuated StAR expression. We conclude 1) steroidogenesis and accumulation of mature StAR protein are inhibited as a consequence of the induction of apoptosis; 2) reduced levels of StAR may be partially attributed to inhibition of import because of the loss of delta psi; 3) loss of steroidogenesis is probably due to loss of StAR synthesis and disruption of delta psi.","Ethylenediamines,Mesylates,Phosphoproteins,Steroids,steroidogenic acute regulatory protein,ethylene dimethanesulfonate,N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine",,"Breast Neoplasms,Estrogen Receptor alpha,Female,Hormones,Humans,Signal Transduction,Transcription Factors"

Exposure to DEHP has been shown to alter ovarian function in humans. Additionally, foods high in fat content, regularly found in the western diet, have been shown to be another potential disruptor of fetal ovarian function. Due to DEHP's lipophilicity, high-fat foods can be easily contaminated. Therefore, exposure to DEHP and a high-fat diet are both health concerns, especially in pregnant women, and the effects of these exposures on fetal oocyte quality and quantity should be elucidated. In this study, our goal was to determine if there are synergistic effects of DEHP exposure at an environmentally relevant level (20 Œºg/kg body weight/day) and high-fat diet on oogenesis and folliculogenesis. Dams were fed with a high-fat diet (45 kcal% fat) or a control diet (10 kcal% fat) 1 week before mating and during pregnancy and lactation. The pregnant mice were dosed with DEHP (20 Œºg/kg body weight/day) or vehicle control from E10.5 to litter birth. We found that treatment with an environmentally relevant dosage of DEHP and consumption of high-fat diet significantly increases synapsis defects in meiosis and affects folliculogenesis in the F1 generation.","Dietary Fats,Endocrine Disruptors,Diethylhexyl Phthalate","cachexia-cancer,cachexie du cancer,exercice physique,exercise,inflammation,metabolism,m√©tabolisme","Cachexia,Exercise Therapy,Humans,Neoplasms"
35995217,-92,,,Unravelling sex-specific BPA toxicokinetics in children using a pediatric PBPK model.,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is a widely known endocrine disruptor (ED) found in many children's products such as toys, feeding utensils, and teething rings. Recent epidemiology association studies have shown postnatal BPA exposure resulted in developing various diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and neurodegeneration, etc., later in their lives. However, little is known about its sex-specific metabolism and consequently internal exposure. The aim of this study was to develop a sex-specific pediatric physiologically based pharmacokinetic model (PBPK) for BPA to compare their toxicokinetic differences. First, the published adult PBPK model was re-validated, and then this model was extended by interpolation to incorporate pediatric sex specific physiological and biochemical parameters. We used both the classical body weight and ontogeny-based scaling approach to interpolate the metabolic process. Then, the pharmacokinetic attributes of the models using the two-scaling approach mentioned above were compared with adult model. Further, a sex-specific PBPK model with an ontogeny scaling approach was preferred to evaluate the pharmacokinetic differences. Moreover, this model was used to reconstruct the BPA exposure from two cohorts (Helix and PBAT Cohort) from 7 EU countries. The half-life of BPA was found to be almost the same in boys and girls at the same exposure levels. Our model estimated BPA children's exposure to be about 1500 times higher than the tolerable daily intake (TDI) recently set by European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) i.e., 0.04¬†ng/kg BW/day. The model demonstrated feasibility of extending the adult PBPK to sex-specific pediatric, thus investigate a gender-specific health risk assessment.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Phenols,bisphenol A","arsenic,cadmium,lead,mercury,prenatal exposure,preterm birth,scoping review","Cadmium,Child,Child, Preschool,Environmental Exposure,Female,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Mercury,Metals, Heavy,Pregnancy,Premature Birth"

32526315,-92,,,Associations between intrauterine exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls on neonatal ano-genital distance.,"Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) are widespread environmental contaminants. PCBs have endocrine disrupting properties which raises concerns regarding their effect on the developing fetus. This study aimed to examine the association between prenatal exposure to PCBs and anogenital distance (AGD) in newborns. Serum concentrations of PCB congeners -118, -138, -153 and -180 were measured in 175 pregnant women presenting to the delivery room. AGD was measured in their newborns. Regression models were used to estimate associations between maternal PCB exposure and infant anogenital measurements, controlling for possible confounding variables. Mean maternal serum concentrations were 2.95 ¬± 2.18 ng/g, 4.62 ¬± 3.54 ng/g, 7.67 ¬± 6.42 ng/g and 5.10 ¬± 3.91 ng/g for congeners -118, -138, -153 and -180, respectively. Higher maternal concentrations of PCBs were associated with reduced AGD measures in male infants. Higher maternal concentrations of PCB-138 and PCB-153 were associated with reduced ano-scrotal distances and higher maternal concentrations of all four PCB congeners were associated with reduced ano-penile distances. No significant associations were found between any PCB congener and any AGD measure in female newborns. This study demonstrates that intrauterine exposure to PCBs may be associated with reduced AGD in male newborns.

33348257,-92,,,Reproductive toxicity in male juvenile rats: Antagonistic effects between isolated agrochemicals and in binary or ternary combinations.,"The management of agrochemicals in Brazilian agriculture impacts global environmental sustainability and food security, since this country is one of the major agro-food exporters in the world. Acephate, carbendazim, and dithiocarbamates (DTCs) such as mancozeb, are among the most detected agrochemicals in Brazilian agro-food products, occurring in combination in several crops, especially in fruit cultures. The present study evaluated the impact of the exposure to isolated agrochemicals and all the combined possible mixtures (binary and ternary forms) on the reproductive parameters of male juvenile rats, known to be a vulnerable biological system and developmental window. Data were analyzed using Generalized Linear Models (GzLM), considering each agrochemical as an independent factor. The study revealed higher reproductive toxicity exerted by isolated agrochemicals when compared to the combined treatments, which exhibited mostly an antagonistic effect. Results suggest endocrine disruptive effects of each one separately on the weight of reproductive organs and testicular histomorphometry, besides changes in testicular SOD activity. The full factorial experimental design employed here allowed us to conclude that it is not possible to scale-up the effects of the isolated treatments to the mixtures, showing how difficult it is to know beforehand the response and cross-talk among the multiple physiological mechanisms disturbed by complex mixtures. Considering that food products are shared on a global scale and that some of these three agrochemicals have already been prohibited in EU countries, the consumption of some Brazilian products puts global human health at risk, that of children.","Agrochemicals,Complex Mixtures,Endocrine Disruptors",,"Carbon Fiber,Electrochemical Techniques,Ferrocyanides,Liposomes,Microelectrodes,Nanopores,Oxidation-Reduction,Phosphatidylcholines,Phosphatidylethanolamines"

EDCs can cause non-communicable diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, thyroid disorders, neurodevelopmental disease, hormone-dependent cancers, and reproductive disorders. The embryoid body test (EBT) is a developmental toxicity test method that determines the size of embryoid bodies (EBs) and the viability of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and fibroblasts (3T3 cells). The present study used the EBT to perform cytotoxicity evaluations of 10 EDCs and assessed the mechanistic relationship between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and cytotoxicity. According to the statistical analysis and prediction model results, methylparaben, butylparaben, propylparaben, ethylparaben, triclosan, octylphenol, methoxychlor, bisphenol A, and diethylstilbestrol were classified as cytotoxic, but trichloroacetic acid was non-toxic. Classification accuracy was 90%. The mechanistic study showed that the cytotoxicities of butylparaben, propylparaben, octylphenol, and triclosan were induced by ER stress. The mRNA expressions of BiP, CHOP, and ATF4 were significantly higher following treatments with four EDCs compared to those after the control treatment. Compared to the control treatment, the mRNA levels of XBP1u and XBP1s increased significantly after butylparaben and propylparaben treatments, but did not increase with octylphenol and triclosan treatments.

Pregnant female rats were exposed to various doses of bisphenol A (BPA) from gestational day 1 (GD1) through 2 hours after parturition. About half of the BPA-exposed and control dams were subjected to cesarean section on GD22. The male fetuses on GD22 were immediately sacrificed and blood was collected. The other half of the BPA-treated and control dams delivered at GD23 (parturition day). The male pups were sacrificed 2 hours after birth. Serum T concentration was determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA). The BPA concentration in the fetal serum on GD22 increased inversely to the T levels in the serum. The T concentration in the pups' serum 2 hours after birth decreased inversely to the BPA concentration in the serum. However, there were no differences in the serum T concentration among the various doses of BPA. These results suggest that exposure to BPA in utero inhibits the T surge in the neonatal period and we speculate that exposure to BPA in utero disrupts the endocrine environment in the neonatal male.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Estrogens, Non-Steroidal,Phenols,Testosterone,bisphenol A","Early diagnosis,Genetic techniques,Interdisciplinary health team,Medullary thyroid cancer","Carcinoma, Neuroendocrine,Child, Preschool,Female,Humans,Pedigree,Thyroid Neoplasms"

Of the 10 pregnant rats in the DES 4.5 group, only 1 delivered, and this rat could not suckle the pups. Rat pups in the DES 0.5 and 1.5 groups were autopsied at 1, 3, 6 and 15 weeks after birth. The testosterone concentrations in the DES 1.5 and 0.5 groups at 6 weeks were significantly decreased and the plasma LH concentrations were not altered. In the DES 1.5 group, DES treatment did not change the volume of the sexually dimorphic nucleus in the preoptic area (SDN-POA) in the male offspring, although this dose of DES increased the volume of SDN-POA in female offspring. The DES treatment altered frequencies in the cycles of the seminiferous tubules, and suppressed histological maturation in the epididymis and the prostate weight. These observations indicate that prenatally administered DES impairs testicular endocrine function continuously as well as pituitary function, but the induced low level of testosterone disrupts spermatogenesis and permanently inhibits the morphological development of epididymis and prostate.","RNA, Messenger,Receptors, LHRH,Diethylstilbestrol","Heavy metal,Interaction effect,Polybrominated diphenyl ethers,Thyroid cancer","Case-Control Studies,China,Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers,Humans,Metals, Heavy,Plasma,Thyroid Neoplasms"

Lead has a long historic relation to several adverse health conditions and was recently classified as an endocrine disruptor. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of subacute exposure to lead on the thyroid gland function. Adult male and female Wistar rats received a lead acetate solution containing 10 or 25\xa0mg/kg, by gavage, three times a week, for 14 days. One week later, behavioral testing showed no alterations in anxiety and motor-exploratory parameters, as evaluated by Open-Field and Plus-Maze Tests, but impairment in learning and memory was found in the male 25\xa0mg/kg lead-treated group and in both female lead-treated groups, as evaluated by the Inhibitory Avoidance Test. After one week, serum levels of tT3 were reduced in the 25\xa0mg/kg female group and in the 10\xa0mg‚àï kg male group. However, tT4 levels were increased in the 25\xa0mg/kg male group and in both female treated groups. TSH levels did not change and lead serum levels were undetectable. Morphologic alterations were observed in the thyroid gland, including abnormal thyroid parenchyma follicles of different sizes, epithelial stratification and vacuolization of follicular cells, decrease in colloid eosinophilia and vascular congestion, accompanied by morphometric alterations. An increase in collagen deposition was also observed. No differences were observed in TPO activity or protein expression, HO generation by NADPH oxidases or hepatic D1 mRNA expression. However, thyroid NIS protein expression was considerably decreased in the male and female lead-treated groups, while TSHr expression was decreased in the 25\xa0mg/kg female lead-treated group.

The outcomes of their co-exposure on the development of male reproductive organs are still unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the risk of exposure to these pesticides, particularly on the postnatal development of the male albino rat reproductive system from postnatal days 23-60. The results revealed that a single IPR or CPF exposure has harmful consequences on the reproductive development and function manifested by reduced testicular weight, serious changes in sperm characteristics, reproductive hormone level imbalance, testicular enzymes, oxidative stress and apoptosis-related enzymes, which correlated with transcription levels of steroidogenic- and spermatogenic-related genes. Histopathologically, both compounds caused severe damage in the testis and accessory glands architecture. Notably, co-exposure to IPR and CPF in rats caused more serious damage, indicative of an additive effect than individual exposure, so concurrent exposure should be avoided as it is more hazardous, especially on male fertility.","Hydantoins,Insecticides,Aminoimidazole Carboxamide,Chlorpyrifos,iprodione","Catalytic and photocatalytic ozonation,Endocrine disrupting compounds,Surface reaction mechanism,Titanium dioxide","Catalysis,Ozone,Pharmaceutical Preparations,Water Pollutants, Chemical,Water Purification"

We performed a screening for in vivo and in vitro anti(estrogenic) activity of dipyrone. For the in vivo uterotrophic assay, immature female rats (22-days-old) were treated daily by oral gavage for three days with different doses of dipyrone alone (50, 100, 200 mg/kg/day) and associated with three ethynylestradiol (EE) doses (1, 3 and 10 Œºg/kg/day), which were based on a dose-response curve experiment. The uterine weight was used as a biomarker for estrogenicity. In a parallel in vitro approach, we used a yeast-based transcriptional activation reporter gene assay (Yeast Estrogen Screening - YES) for assessment of estrogenic agonistic and antagonistic effects of dipyrone and its main metabolites 4-methylaminoantipyrine (MAA) and 4-aminoantipyrine (AA). In the uterotrophic assay, animals that received EE at 1, 3 and 10 Œºg/kg/day showed an increase in relative uterine weight compared with vehicle-only rats (canola oil). Dipyrone did not increase uterine weight at any dose tested (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg/day) in relation to vehicle control, indicating absence of estrogenic activity. Furthermore, co-administration of dipyrone (50 and 200 mg/kg/day) and EE (1, 3 or 10 Œºg/kg/day) was unable to block EE estrogenic action in comparison to the groups treated with EE alone, indicating absence of antiestrogenic activity. In the YES assay dipyrone and its metabolites did not demonstrate estrogen agonistic or antagonistic properties in the yeast cells. These results suggest that dipyrone and its metabolites do not produce (anti)estrogenic effects in vivo or in vitro.","Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal,Estrogens,Dipyrone","Gene polymorphism,Meta-analysis,Susceptibility,Type 2 diabetes","Cation Transport Proteins,Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2,Genetic Association Studies,Genetic Predisposition to Disease,Genotype,Humans,Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide,Zinc Transporter 8"

However, the cellular effects of BPA on the eyes have not been widely investigated. This study aimed to investigate the cellular cytotoxicity by BPA exposure on human retinoblastoma cells. BPA did not show cytotoxic effects, such as apoptosis, alterations to cell viability and cell cycle regulation. Comparative analysis of the transcriptome and proteome profiles were investigated after long-term exposure of Y79 cells to low doses of BPA. Transcriptome analysis using RNA-seq revealed that mRNA expression of the post-transcriptional regulation-associated gene sets was significantly upregulated in the BPA-treated group. Cell cycle regulation-associated gene sets were significantly downregulated by exposure to BPA. Interestingly, RNA-seq analysis at the transcript level indicated that alternative splicing events, particularly retained introns, were noticeably altered by low-dose BPA treatment. Additionally, proteome profiling using MALDI-TOF-MS identified a total of nine differentially expressed proteins. These results suggest that alternative splicing events and altered gene/protein expression patterns are critical phenomena affected by long-term low-dose BPA exposure. This represents a novel marker for the detection of various diseases associated with environmental pollutants such as BPA.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Phenols,Proteome,bisphenol A",,"Cell Communication,Metal Nanoparticles,Neuroendocrine Cells"

Thyroidectomy was also performed to evaluate the contribution of the thyroid gland in affecting ovarian dysfunction and reproductive aberrations. We confirmed that the preconception exposure of HCB leads to hypothyroidism which was reflected by an increase in the body weight, alteration in the thyroid hormones, and alteration of the lipid profile. Hypothyroid female rats exhibited a poor reproductive profile with altered steroidogenic pathways, altered estrus cyclicity, reduced litter size, and stunted growth. The external supplementation of thyroxine in thyroidectomized animals rescues the reproductive aberrations confirming the protective role of the thyroid gland in reproductive biology.

We analyzed data on 2014 male and female participants to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted between 2015 and 2016 aged 6 or older. In linear regression adjusted for age and potential confounders, serum total testosterone was 37.78% lower with 10-fold increase in urinary total neonicotinoids (95% CI: -58.82, -6.00), 20.81% lower with 10-fold increase in urinary 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid (95% CI: -34.94, -3.62) and 25.01% lower with 10-fold increase in urinary n-desmethyl-acetamiprid (95% CI: -39.80, -6.58) among males. Serum free androgen index (FAI) was also decreased with higher urinary n-desmethyl-acetamiprid. In females, serum total testosterone was 32.91% lower with 10-fold increase in urinary total neonicotinoids (95% CI: -54.93, -0.13), 21.32% lower with 10-fold increase in urinary 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid (95% CI: -29.31, -12.42) and 15.42% lower with urinary detection of 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid (95% CI: -22.80, -7.34). FAI was likewise reduced with higher urinary levels of 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid and N-desmethyl-acetamiprid.

In mammals, a series of chromosomal events occur during the meiotic stage of oocytes. External toxins may enter the body and cause infertility and other related diseases. Therefore, it is crucial to explore the influence of DEHP exposure on the molecular mechanism of germ cell meiosis. We used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyse the ovaries of foetal mice at embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) and E14.5 after maternal DEHP exposure. DEHP exposure further activated the pathways related to DNA repair in germ cells, increased the expression of genes related to DNA damage and changed the developmental trajectory of germ cells. DEHP exposure may affect the proliferation of pregranulosa (PG) cells. Moreover, DEHP exposure altered the signal transduction between PG cells and germ cells.

Pregnancy is believed to have long-term protective effects against breast cancer development; however, it is unknown if EDCs can alter this effect. We examined the long-term effects of propylparaben, a common preservative used in personal care products and foods, with estrogenic properties, on the parous mouse mammary gland. Pregnant BALB/c mice were treated with 0, 20, 100, or 10 000 ¬µg/kg/day propylparaben throughout pregnancy and lactation. Unexposed nulliparous females were also evaluated. Five weeks post-involution, mammary glands were collected and assessed for changes in histomorphology, hormone receptor expression, immune cell number, and gene expression. For several parameters of mammary gland morphology, propylparaben reduced the effects of parity. Propylparaben also increased proliferation, but not stem cell number, and induced modest alterations to expression of ERŒ±-mediated genes. Finally, propylparaben altered the effect of parity on the number of several immune cell types in the mammary gland. These results suggest that propylparaben, at levels relevant to human exposure, can interfere with the effects of parity on the mouse mammary gland and induce long-term alterations to mammary gland structure. Future studies should address if propylparaben exposures negate the protective effects of pregnancy on mammary cancer development.","Endocrine Disruptors,Parabens,propylparaben","Bisphenol S,endocrine disruptors,granulosa cells,proliferation,steroidogenesis,women","Cells, Cultured,Cholesterol Side-Chain Cleavage Enzyme,Female,Follicular Fluid,Gene Expression Regulation,Granulosa Cells,Humans,In Vitro Techniques,Phenols,Progesterone,Sulfones"

Human and animal research suggests that PFAS compounds disrupt hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function, with some evidence of altered ""anxiety-like"" behavior, but little is known about the potential effects on maternal mental health following exposures during pregnancy. Evaluating the consequences of gestational PFAS exposures on maternal health is essential, because approximately 1 in 10 women experience postpartum depression, often with increased anxiety. To address this gap, dams were exposed to a low dose, 0.1¬†mg/kg, of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) from gestational day 0 to birth. Maternal behavior was then observed from postnatal days 5-9, and ""anxiety-like"" behavior was measured using open field spontaneous locomotor behavior and elevated plus maze following weaning. No difference was observed in the litter size or sex of offspring. Gestational PFOA exposure altered maternal behavior. Despite similar nursing durations, PFOA dams spent more time nursing in a flat posture and on their side, and less time in kyphosis. Despite significantly quicker first contact, PFOA dams did not return pups to the nest quicker, indicating reduced retrieval latency. At weaning, dams displayed increased ""anxiety-like"" behaviors in the elevated plus maze with a significantly higher mean duration in the closed arms and reduced choice frequency with significantly lower number of entries in the closed and open arms. PFOA dams showed reductions in ambulatory movement across the session. Pregnancy exposure to PFOA altered both maternal and ""anxiety-like"" behavior in dams. Additional assays focused on depression-associated behaviors, such as forced swim, anhedonia, and social preference, will further delineate behavioral mechanisms. Further research on the effects of environmental contaminant exposures during pregnancy should investigate how co-exposures to other risk factors, such as stress, may enhance behavioral toxicity.

We observed increased levels of reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde, decreased levels of reduced glutathione, in the kidney at higher dose for both chemicals suggestive of oxidative damage. Elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-Œ± and interleukin-6 of the kidney further suggested inflammatory status as a result of phthalate exposure in both high dose groups. Targeted lipidomics demonstrated greatest changes in the kidney induced by high dose of DEHP, although DINP also induced significant changes in phospholipids diacylglycerides that are associated with lipid accumulation in glomerular podocytes and inflammatory responses. Our data suggest that oxidative stress may be involved in both DEHP- and DINP-induced renal lipidomic disruption and continue to question the suitability of DINP as proper DEHP substitute.","Phthalic Acids,phthalic acid,Diethylhexyl Phthalate","endocrine disruptors,phthalic acids,preconception care,pregnancy,unplanned¬†pregnancy","Child,Child Development,Environmental Pollutants,Female,Humans,Infant,Intention,Maternal Exposure,Phthalic Acids,Pregnancy,Pregnant Women,Prospective Studies"

21777606,-91,,,Adolescent cannabinoid exposure attenuates adult female sexual motivation but does not alter adulthood CB1R expression or estrous cyclicity.,"Adolescence is a developmental period characterized by neuronal remodeling and the maturation of adult emotionality, reproductive behavior and social behavior. We examined whether chronic cannabinoid exposure in adolescent rats alters female sexual motivation, estrous cyclicity, sucrose preference, and CB(1)R expression in adulthood. Female rats were administered with the synthetic cannabinoid agonist, CP-55,940 (0.4 mg/kg, intraperitoneal), daily during adolescent development (PND 35-45). In a subset of subjects, socio-sexual motivation was investigated in adulthood (PND 75-86) using a runway apparatus. Estrous cyclicity was tracked in adulthood via vaginal cytology and a single-mount test. A two-bottle sucrose preference test was also conducted to determine whether predicted changes in socio-sexual motivation might be linked to alterations in hedonic processing. CB(1)R expression was examined in two separate subsets of subjects, one sacrificed following drug treatment (PND 46) and one before behavioral testing (PND 74). Drug treatment significantly decreased adult preference for a male conspecific (sexual motivation), as assessed by both Run Time and Proximity Time, but did not affect estrous cyclicity or sucrose preference. CP-55,940 treatment also induced immediate, but transient, decreases in CB(1)R expression in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus and amygdala. Drug treatment did not affect CB(1)R expression in the nucleus accumbens (core or shell) or globus pallidus at either time point. We suggest that the endocannabinoid system may play a role in the maturation of neuroendocrine axes and adult female reproductive behavior, and that chronic exposure to cannabinoids during adolescence disrupts these neurodevelopmental processes.","Cannabinoids,Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1","DOHaD,EDC,childhood,prenatal,programming","Child,Child Health,Endocrine Disruptors,Humans"
32901497,-91,,,In vitro assessment of the impact of nickel on the viability and steroidogenesis in the human adrenocortical carcinoma (NCI-H295R) cell line.,"Nickel is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant, which has various effects on reproductive endocrinology. In this study, human adrenocortical carcinoma (NCI-H295R) cell line was used as an in vitro biological model to study the effect of nickel chloride (NiCl2) on the viability and steroidogenesis. The cells were exposed to different concentrations (3.90; 7.80; 15.60; 31.20; 62.50; 125; 250 and 500 microM) of NiCl2 and compared with control group (culture medium without NiCl2). The cell viability was measured by the metabolic activity assay. Production of sexual steroid hormones was quantified by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Following 48 h culture of the cells in the presence of NiCl2 a dose-dependent depletion of progesterone release was observed even at the lower concentrations. In fact, lower levels of progesterone were detected in groups with higher doses (>/=125 microM) of NiCl2 (P<0.01), which also elicited cytotoxic action. A more prominent decrease in testosterone production (P<0.01) was also noted in comparison to that of progesterone. On the other hand, the release of 17beta-estradiol was substantially increased at low concentrations (3.90 to 62.50 microM) of NiCl2. The cell viability remained relatively unaltered up to 125 microM (P>0.05) and slightly decreased from 250 microM of NiCl2 (P<0.05). Our results indicate endocrine disruptive effect of NiCl2 on the release of progesterone and testosterone in the NCI-H295R cell line. Although no detrimental effect of NiCl2 (</=62.50 microM) could be found on 17beta-estradiol production, its toxicity may reflect at other points of the steroidogenic pathway.","Endocrine Disruptors,Testosterone,Progesterone,Estradiol,Nickel","Chemicals of emerging concern,Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs),Environment,Human exposure,Parabens,Susceptible population","Child,China,Cosmetics,Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Exposure,Female,Humans,India,Parabens,Pregnancy"
34774353,-91,,,Low-dose perfluorooctanoic acid stimulates steroid hormone synthesis in Leydig cells: Integrated proteomics and metabolomics evidence.,"Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), one of the well-known perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), has been widespread in the environment and associated with male reproductive toxicity. However, the molecular mechanism involved in low-level PFOA-induced male endocrine disruption remains to be elucidated. In this study, we performed a combined proteomics and metabolomics analysis to investigate the proteomic and metabolic alterations in MLTC-1 Leydig cells responsive to low levels of PFOA exposure. The results showed that PFOA significantly regulated the expressions of 67 proteins and 17 metabolites, among which 18 proteins and 7 metabolites were specifically tied to lipid and fatty acid metabolism as well as testicular steroidogenesis. It is further suggested that low-dose PFOA stimulates steroid hormone synthesis by accelerating fatty acid metabolism and steroidogenic process, which is involved in the repression of p38 and cAMP-dependent ERK signaling pathway. The animal studies also revealed that environmentally relevant levels of PFOA increased serum steroid hormone levels accompanied by the activated cAMP and inhibited p38/ERK pathway in testis, which confirmed our in vitro findings. Overall, the present study will provide novel insights into the toxicological mechanisms of low-level PFOA-mediated steroidogenic disturbance, and may implicate the reproductive health risk of humans with environmental PFOA exposure.","Caprylates,Fluorocarbons,Hormones,Steroids,perfluorooctanoic acid","Consanguineous families,Endocrine genes,Genetic testing,Novel genes,Paediatric endocrinology","Child,Congenital Hyperinsulinism,Consanguinity,Diabetes Mellitus,Dwarfism,Humans,KATP Channels,Mutation"

However, whether BPA affects the development of primary sensory systems, which are the first to mature in the cortex, remains largely unclear. Using the rat as a model, we aimed to record the physiological and structural changes in the primary auditory cortex (A1) following lactational BPA exposure and their possible effects on behavioral outcomes. We found that BPA-exposed rats showed significant behavioral impairments when performing a sound temporal rate discrimination test. A significant alteration in spectral and temporal processing was also recorded in their A1, manifested as degraded frequency selectivity and diminished stimulus rate-following by neurons. These post-exposure effects were accompanied by changes in the density and maturity of dendritic spines in A1. Our findings demonstrated developmental impacts of BPA on auditory cortical processing and auditory-related discrimination, particularly in the temporal domain. Thus, the health implications for humans associated with early exposure to endocrine disruptors such as BPA merit more careful examination.","bisphenol A,Benzhydryl Compounds,Phenols","Birth cohort,ESR1 polymorphism,Gene environment interaction,Hand digit ratio,Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances","Child,Digit Ratios,Estrogen Receptor alpha,Female,Fluorocarbons,Humans,Japan,Male,Pregnancy,Prospective Studies,Retrospective Studies"

In the previous studies of mice treated with dityrosine, cell death in the pancreas, kidneys, and liver was detected in the presence of enhanced plasma triiodothyronine (T3) content. Due to its structural similarity with the thyroid hormone T3, we hypothesized that dityrosine might disrupt T3-dependent endocrine signaling. The cytotoxic effect of dityrosine was studied in C57BL/6 mice by gavage with a dityrosine dose of 320 Œºg per kg per day for 10 weeks. Cell death in the liver was detected in the presence of enhanced plasma thyroid hormone content in mice treated with dityrosine. The antagonistic effect of dityrosine on T3 biofunction was studied using HepG2 cells. Dityrosine incubation reduced T3 transport ability and attenuated the T3-mediated cell survival  regulation of the PI3k/Akt/MAPK pathway. Furthermore, dityrosine inhibited T3 binding to thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) and suppressed the TR-mediated transcription. Dityrosine also downregulated the expressions of T3 action-related factors. Taken together, this study demonstrates that dityrosine inhibits T3-dependent cytoprotection by competitive inhibition, resulting in downstream gene suppression. Our findings offer insights into how dityrosine acts as an antagonist of T3.

The aim was to apply novel in vitro methods, which have been sufficiently technically and scientifically validated for the purposes of toxicological testing of chemicals. The study included several toxicological endpoints such as skin/eye irritation, skin sensitization, endocrine disruption and genotoxicity. The battery of selected methods comprised regulatory accepted EpiDerm‚Ñ¢ skin model (OECD TG 439); EpiOcular‚Ñ¢ corneal model (OECD TG 492) and scientifically valid test method HET-CAM (DB-ALM Protocol No. 47); in chemico test DPRA (OECD TG 442C); in vitro test LuSens (OECD TG 442D) and in vitro test h-CLAT (OECD TG 442E); Ames MPF‚Ñ¢ (Xenometrix) and XenoScreen YES/YAS (Xenometrix). Overall, none of the 4 allowed parabens exhibited skin/eye irritation or genotoxicity. However, all allowed parabens in cosmetics were predicted as samples with potentially sensitizing properties in the LuSens and h-CLAT test methods, but not confirmed by DPRA. Endocrine disruption was recorded only at high concentrations, whereas methyl paraben and ethyl paraben exhibited the lowest activity.

This study characterized a 3D in vitro model of murine prepubertal Leydig TM3 cells with improved expression of steroidogenesis markers suitable for image-based screening of testicular toxicity. This 3D scaffold-free spheroid model was applied to explore the impact of prototypical endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and environmental reprotoxicants (benzo[a]pyrene, 2- and 9-methylanthracenes, fluoranthene, triclosan, triclocarban, methoxychlor) on male reproductive health. The results were compared to the male reprotoxicity potential of EDCs assessed in a traditional monolayer (2D) culture. The testicular toxicity was dependent not only on the type of culture (2D vs. 3D models) but also on the duration of exposure. Benzo[a]pyrene and triclocarban were the most active compounds, eliciting cytotoxic effects in prepubertal Leydig cells at low micromolar concentrations, which might be a mechanism contributing to their male reprotoxicity.","Endocrine Disruptors,Benzo(a)pyrene","bisphenol A,cancer and critical periods of development,immune system,phthalates","Child,Endocrine Disruptors,Female,Humans,Immune System,Microplastics,Neoplasms,Plastics,Pregnancy"

Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate whether exposure to acephate during maternal gestation and lactation histologically damages the testes of male Wistar rats in adulthood. For this study, adult Wistar rats were divided into the following groups: ACE-mother, (2.5¬†mg/kg/bw, gestational day (GD) 7 to postnatal day (PND) 21) and oil-mother (corn oil (control), GD 7 to PND 21). The male offspring (PND 90) were euthanized, and the prostates and testes were collected and weighed. The testes were utilized for histopathological analyses and to determine the sperm count. A spermatogenesis kinetic analysis revealed an increased number of seminiferous tubules in stages I-VI in the ACE-mother group. Additionally, we observed a decrease in the epithelium and the diameters of the evaluated seminiferous tubules and in the number of Sertoli cells in the group exposed to acephate. The sperm count analysis showed no difference between the groups. We conclude that maternal exposure to the pesticide acephate did not affect testicular function, but led to the impairment of testicular development and morphology of the tissue in adulthood.","Insecticides,Organothiophosphorus Compounds,Phosphoramides,acephate","BPA,DEHP,cardiotoxicity,endocrine-disrupting chemical,environmental,heart","Child,Humans,Infant,Outcome Assessment, Health Care,Phthalic Acids,Plastics"
19720131,-90,,,Some nonylphenol isomers show antiestrogenic potency in the MVLN cell assay.,"It has been shown that nonylphenol (NP) isomers vary in their estrogenic potency. These differences may be due to varieties in receptor affinity, receptor activation, or activation/deactivation of non-receptor mediated side paths of reporter gene translation. In the present study we investigated the underlying mechanism of the different estrogenic potency of seven nonylphenol isomers. An estrogen receptor binding assay was conducted with the human estrogen receptor alpha (hERalpha). Additionally we co-incubated the nonylphenol isomers with two concentrations of 17beta-estradiol (E2) in the MVLN cell assay to measure the potency of the isomers to compete with E2. No significant differences were found between the nonylphenol isomer binding affinities for the hERalpha. The IC(50) were in the range of 2.1-8.1x10(-6)M and the binding affinity relative to estradiol (set to 1) were between 2.6 and 6.7x10(-3). Only two test items (p353-NP and p-NP) were able to increase the estrogenic response of 100pM estradiol. The response of the other isomers co-incubated with 100pM E2 showed varying degrees of inhibition of the response in the MVLN reporter gene assay. Thus, it appears that all isomers bind to the ER but some are partial agonists while others are antagonists in the MVLN reporter gene assay.","Endocrine Disruptors,Estrogen Antagonists,Estrogen Receptor alpha,Ligands,Phenols,Estradiol,nonylphenol","Demographic characteristics,Endocrine-disrupting chemicals,Health risk,Human exposure,Urine","China,Demography,Endocrine Disruptors,Female,Humans,Parabens,Triclosan"

Data from animal and human studies have demonstrated that early exposure to BPA results in adverse metabolic outcomes in adult life. In the present work, we exposed pregnant heterozygous estrogen receptor Œ≤ (ERŒ≤) knock out (BERKO) mice to 10¬†Œºg/kg/day BPA, during days 9-16 of pregnancy, and measured Œ≤-cell mass and proliferation in wildtype (WT) and BERKO male offspring at postnatal day 30. We observed increased pancreatic Œ≤-cell proliferation and mass in WT, yet no effect was produced in BERKO mice. Dispersed islet cells in primary culture treated with 1¬†nM BPA showed an enhanced pancreatic Œ≤-cell replication rate, which was blunted in pancreatic Œ≤-cells from BERKO mice and mimicked by the selective ERŒ≤ agonist WAY200070. This increased Œ≤-cell proliferation was found in male adult as well as in neonate pancreatic Œ≤-cells, suggesting that BPA directly impacts Œ≤-cell division at earliest stages of life. These findings strongly indicate that BPA during pregnancy upregulates pancreatic Œ≤-cell division and mass in an ERŒ≤-dependent manner. Thus, other natural or artificial chemicals may use this ERŒ≤-mediated pathway to promote similar effects.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Estrogen Receptor beta,Phenols,bisphenol A","Nonylphenol (NP),Rural,Urban,Urine,Water","China,Drinking Water,Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Monitoring,Humans,Phenols,Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Exposure to some FRs have been associated to endocrine disruption and neurodevelopmental disorders. Previous research has shown higher FR concentrations in toddlers' serum and urine, but which toddler-behaviors influence exposure levels remains to be determined. We investigated how toddler-behaviors are associated to FRs in hand wipes (HWs) and saliva. Fifty 8-18 month-old children from the Linking EDCs in maternal Nutrition to Child health study, were visited at home. The child's behavior was observed and assessed using a questionnaire. Hand-to-object behavior frequency was associated with HW tris(chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), tris(1,3-dichloroisopropyl) phosphate (TDCIPP), tris(phenyl) phosphate, tris(methylphenyl) phosphate, and resorcinol bis(diphenyl phosphate) levels above the detection limit. Children playing with electronics multiple times per week had higher TDCIPP HW levels compared to children playing with electronics once per month or never (p¬†=¬†0.032 and p¬†=¬†0.046). Frequent mouth-to-object and frequent mouthing a pacifier were associated with lower TDCIPP (p¬†=¬†0.019) and tris(2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCIPP) HW levels, respectively (p¬†=¬†0.002-0.019). Exposure estimates based on hand-to-mouth behavior did not exceed the available reference doses. This is the first study investigating toddler-behavior in relation to FR hand loadings. Although a range of behaviors was investigated, only a few showed a relation with FR HW levels, suggesting that toddler-behavior might not alone be responsible for the elevated FR levels in children. It is therefore important to explore other pathways including dermal absorption and inhalation.","Dust,Flame Retardants,Organophosphates,Phosphates,tris(1,3-dichloroisopropyl) phosphate","Aquatic species,Ecological risk,Machine learning,Prediction,Reproductive toxicity","China,Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Monitoring,Machine Learning,Risk Assessment,Rivers,Water Pollutants, Chemical"

This study investigated endocrine, reproductive and behavioral effects of diclofenac in male and female offspring rats exposed in utero from gestational days 10-20. Pregnant rats were treated with diclofenac at doses of 0.2, 1 and 5 mg/kg/day via oral gavage. Anogenital distance (AGD), number of nipples, and developmental landmarks of puberty onset - vaginal opening (VO), first estrus (FE) and preputial separation (PPS) - were evaluated in the offspring. At adulthood, behavioral and reproductive parameters were assessed. Male and female rats were tested in the elevated plus maze test to assess locomotor activity and anxiety-like behaviors, while male rats were also evaluated in the partner preference test. No significant effects were observed on AGD and number of nipples in both males and females. Diclofenac treatment induced an overall delay in developmental landmarks of puberty onset in male and female offspring, which reached statistical significance for PPS at the lowest diclofenac dose. Prenatal exposure to all tested doses abolished the preference of male rats for an estrous female, suggesting an impairment of brain masculinization. No changes were observed on male or female reproductive parameters at adulthood. Overall, our results indicate that prenatal exposure to therapeutically relevant doses of diclofenac may have an impact in the pubertal development of rats and negatively affect male partner preference behavior.","Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal,Diclofenac","CCK,Diabetes,Enteroendocrine,GIP,GLP-1,Gut hormone,Obesity,PYY","Cholecystokinin,Gastric Inhibitory Polypeptide,Glucagon-Like Peptide 1,Humans,Obesity,Peptide YY"

The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of exposure to TCS and DEHP, as well as their combinations, on biomarkers related to acute toxicity and DNA instability, in HepG2 cells, by use of cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome (CBMNCyt) assay. For that, the cultures were exposed to TCS, DEHP and combinations at doses of 0.10, 1.0, and 10 ŒºM for the period of 4 h and the parameters related to DNA damage (i.e., frequencies of micronuclei (MN) and nuclear buds (NBUDs), to cell division (i.e., nuclear division index (NDI) and nuclear division cytotoxic index (NDCI) and to cell death (apoptotic and necrotic cells) were scored. Clear mutagenic effects were seen in cells treated with TCS, DEHP at doses of 1.0 and 10 ŒºM, but no combined effects were observed when the cells were exposed to the combinations of TCS + DEHP. On the other hand, the combination of the toxicants significantly increased the frequencies of apoptotic and necrotic cells, as well as induced alterations of biomarkers related to cell viability (NDI and NDCI), when compared to the groups treated only with TCS or DEHP.

34627821,-90,,,Effect of 17Œ≤-trenbolone exposure during adolescence on the circadian rhythm in male mice.,"The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the main control area of the clock rhythm in the mammalian brain. It drives daily behaviours and rhythms by synchronizing or suppressing the oscillations of clock genes in peripheral tissue. It is an important brain tissue structure that affects rhythm stability. SCN has high plasticity and is easily affected by the external environment. In this experiment, we found that exposure to the endocrine disruptor 17Œ≤-trenbolone (17Œ≤-TBOH) affects the rhythmic function of SCN in the brains of adolescent male balb/c mice. Behavioural results showed that exposure to 17Œ≤-TBOH disrupted daily activity-rest rhythms, reduced the robustness of endogenous rhythms, altered sleep-wake-related behaviours, and increased the stress to light stimulation. At the cellular level, exposure to 17Œ≤-TBOH decreased the c-fos immune response of SCN neurons to the large phase shift, indicating that it affected the coupling ability of SCN neurons. At the molecular level, exposure to 17Œ≤-TBOH interfered with the daily expression of hormones, changed the expression levels of the core clock genes and cell communication genes in the SCN, and affected the expression of wake-up genes in the hypothalamus. Finally, we observed the effect of exposure to 17Œ≤-TBOH on energy metabolism. The results showed that 17Œ≤-TBOH reduced the metabolic response and affected the metabolic function of the liver. This study revealed the influence of environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) on rhythms and metabolic disorders, and provides references for follow-up research.","Endocrine Disruptors,Trenbolone Acetate","Drugs,Endocrine disruptors,Exposition,Exposure,M√©dicaments,Neonates,Nouveau-n√©s,Parabens,Parab√®nes,Perturbateur endocriniens","Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid,Drug Compounding,Endocrine Disruptors,France,Hospital Units,Hospitalization,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Inpatients,Neonatology,Parabens,Preservatives, Pharmaceutical,Prospective Studies"

The aim of this study was to evaluate the way in which fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO) rs9939609 and leptin receptor (LEPR) rs9436303 variants contribute to variability in body mass index (BMI) according to estimated dietary exposure of bisphenols and parabens. This cross-sectional study included 101 Spanish participants (16-24 years). SNP genotyping assays were performed through quantitative PCRs (qPCRs) using Taqman¬Æ probes. Dietary exposure to bisphenols and parabens was calculated from food frequency questionnaire and chemical determination in food samples by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry system. Linear regression models were conducted to address the association of genetic variants and BMI according to levels of bisphenols/parabens exposure.

35202277,-90,,,Early Warnings by Liver Organoids on Short- and Long-Chain PFAS Toxicity.,"Short-chain per-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have replaced long-chains in many applications, however the toxicity and its mode of action and interactions due to the large number of these compounds and their mixtures is still poorly understood. The paper aims to compare the effects on mouse liver organoids (target organ for bioaccumulation) of two long-chain PFAS (perfluorooctane sulfonate -PFOS-, perfluorooctanoic acid -PFOA) and two short-chain PFAS commonly utilized in the industry (heptafluorobutyric acid -HFBA-, Pentafluoropropionic anhydride-PFPA) to identify the mode of action of these classes of contaminants. Cytomorphological aberrations and ALT/GDH enzyme disruption were identified but no acute toxicity endpoint neither apoptosis was detected by the two tested short-chain PFAS. After cytomorphological analysis, it is evident that short-chain PFAS affected organoid morphology inducing a reduction of cytostructural complexity and aberrant cytological features. Conversely, EC50 values of 670 ¬± 30 ¬µM and 895 ¬± 7 ¬µM were measured for PFOS and PFOA, respectively, together with strong ALT/GDH enzyme disruption, caspase 3 and 7 apoptosis activation and deep loss of architectural complexity of organoids in the range of 500-1000 ¬µM. Eventually, biochemical markers and histology analysis confirmed the sensitivity of organoid tests that could be used as a fast and reproducible platform to test many PFAS and mixtures saving time and at low cost in comparison with in vivo tests. Organoids testing could be introduced as an innovative platform to assess the toxicity to fast recognize potentially dangerous pollutants.",,"Pharmaceuticals prioritisation,Risk assessment trace level determination,Water quality","Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid,Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Monitoring,Fresh Water,Pharmaceutical Preparations,Solid Phase Extraction,Tandem Mass Spectrometry,Water Pollutants, Chemical"

In this study we analyzed associations between increased circulating retinol concentrations and altered bone mineral density in a mouse model following oral exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlordibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Additionally, effects of TCDD on differentiation marker genes and genes involved with retinoic acid metabolism were analysed in an osteoblast cell model followed by benchmark dose-response analyses of the gene expression data. Study results show that the increased trabecular and decreased cortical bone mineral density in the mouse model following TCDD exposure are associated with increased circulating retinol concentrations. Also, TCDD disrupted the expression of genes involved in osteoblast differentiation and retinoic acid synthesis, degradation, and nuclear translocation in directions compatible with increasing cellular retinoic acid levels. Further evaluation of the obtained results in relation to previously published data by the use of mode-of-action and weight-of-evidence inspired analytical approaches strengthened the evidence that TCDD-induced bone and retinoid system changes are causally related and compatible with an endocrine disruption mode of action.","Environmental Pollutants,Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins,Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon,Vitamin A","Arctic,Climate change,Endocrine disrupting compounds,Generalized linear models,New POPs,PAHs","Chromatography, Liquid,Climate Change,Environmental Monitoring,Environmental Pollutants,Norway,Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons,Seasons,Svalbard,Tandem Mass Spectrometry,Water,Water Pollutants, Chemical"

This period is sensitive to external stimuli, which ultimately affects the development of nerves and the formation of social behaviour. 17Œ≤-Trenbolone (17Œ≤-TBOH) is an endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), which had been widely reported in aquatic vertebrates. But there is little known about the effects of 17Œ≤-TBOH on mammals, especially on adolescent neurodevelopment.

Through a series of behavioural tests, exposure to 80\xa0Œºgkg d of 17Œ≤-TBOH during adolescence increased the anxiety-like behaviour of mice and reduced the control of wheel-running behaviour and the response of social interaction behaviour. The results of TH immunofluorescence staining showed that exposure to 17Œ≤-TBOH reduced dopamine axon growth in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). In addition, the results of real-time PCR showed that exposure to 17Œ≤-TBOH not only down-regulated the expression of dopamine axon development genes, but also affected the balance of excitatory/inhibitory signals in mPFC.

32951901,-89,,,Are bioplastics and plant-based materials safer than conventional plastics? In vitro toxicity and chemical composition.,"Plastics contain a complex mixture of known and unknown chemicals; some of which can be toxic. Bioplastics and plant-based materials are marketed as sustainable alternative to conventional plastics. However, little is known with regard to the chemicals they contain and the safety of these compounds. Thus, we extracted 43 everyday bio-based and/or biodegradable products as well as their precursors, covering mostly food contact materials made of nine material types, and characterized these extracts using in vitro bioassays and non-target high-resolution mass spectrometry. Two-third (67%) of the samples induced baseline toxicity, 42% oxidative stress, 23% antiandrogenicity and one sample estrogenicity. In total, we detected 41,395 chemical features with 186-20,965 features present in the individual samples. 80% of the extracts contained >1000 features, most of them unique to one sample. We tentatively identified 343 priority compounds including monomers, oligomers, plastic additives, lubricants and non-intentionally added substances. Extracts from cellulose- and starch-based materials generally triggered a strong in vitro toxicity and contained most chemical features. The toxicological and chemical signatures of polyethylene (Bio-PE), polyethylene terephthalate (Bio-PET), polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT), polybutylene succinate (PBS), polylactic acid (PLA), polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) and bamboo-based materials varied with the respective product rather than the material. Toxicity was less prevalent and potent in raw materials than in final products. A comparison with conventional plastics indicates that bioplastics and plant-based materials are similarly toxic. This highlights the need to focus more on aspects of chemical safety when designing truly ""better"" plastic alternatives.","Plastics,Polyhydroxyalkanoates","LC-MS,Multiplex isotope labeling,Quantitative analysis,Solid phase extraction,Solid-phase labeling","Chromatography, Liquid,Estrogens,Isotopes,Limit of Detection,Solid Phase Extraction,Tandem Mass Spectrometry,Water Pollutants, Chemical"
33013709,-89,,,Perinatal Exposure to Methoxychlor Affects Reproductive Function and Sexual Behavior in Mice.,"Numerous chemicals derived from human activity are now disseminated in the environment where their exert estrogenic endocrine disrupting effects, and therefore represent major health concerns. The present study explored whether Methoxychlor (MXC), an insecticide with xenoestrogens activities, given during the perinatal period (from gestational day 11 to postnatal day 8) and at an environmentally dose [20 Œºg/kg (body weight)/day], would affect reproductive physiology and sexual behavior of the offspring in mice. While MXC exposure did not induce any differences in the weight gain of animals from birth to 4 months of age, a clear difference (although in opposite direction according to the sexes) was observed on the anogenital distance between intact and exposed animals. A similar effect was also observed on preputial separation and vaginal opening, which reflects, respectively, in males and females, puberty occurrence. The advanced puberty observed in females was associated with an enhanced expression of kisspeptin cells in the anteroventral periventricular region of the medial preoptic area. Exposure to MXC did not induce in adult females changes in the estrous cycle or in the weight of the female reproductive tract. By contrast, males showed reduced weight of the epididymis and seminiferous vesicles associated with reduced testosterone levels and seminiferous tubule diameter. We also showed that both males and females showed deficits in mate preference tests. As a whole, our results show that MXC impacts reproductive outcomes.","Endocrine Disruptors,Insecticides,Kisspeptins,Methoxychlor","Benzophenone,CatSper Ca2+ channel,Endocrine disruptor,Human biomonitoring,Seminal fluid,UV filter","Chromatography, Liquid,Fetus,Humans,Male,Sunscreening Agents,Tandem Mass Spectrometry"
33254616,-89,,,Exposure to endocrine disruptor alkylphenols and the occurrence of endometrial cancer.,"Exposure to environmental chemicals with oestrogenic effects has been associated with the development of endometrial cancer (EMCa). EMCa has become the most commonly diagnosed cancer of the female genital tract. To further understand the potential association between exposure to environmental endocrine disruptors and the occurrence of EMCa, we performed a case-control study between 2011 and 2014. We aimed to detect and compare concentrations of a known hormone disruptor, alkylphenol, between women diagnosed with either EMCa or uterine leiomyoma, and those who did not have either of these. Subjects were women diagnosed with either EMCa or uterine leiomyoma (LM) and healthy controls. A structured questionnaire was administered to collect information on lifestyle and health status. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry was used to measure urinary NP and OP concentrations in participants. Multiple regression analysis was used to examine the association between exposure and outcomes. Overall, 397 women were recruited, including 49 with EMCa, 247 with LM, and 101 controls. Among them, 73.6% showed detectable levels of NP and 61.0% showed detectable levels of OP. The EMCa group had a significantly higher NP concentration than the control group. Higher OP concentrations were also found in participants with EMCa than those with LM and controls. In addition, women in the upper tertile of the NP group had a significantly increased risk of EMCa occurrence (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]¬†=¬†4.47 [1.69-11.84] for EMCa vs. control). The same was found in the group of women with more than the median level of OP (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]¬†=¬†4.32 [2.01-9.30] for EMCa vs. LM). Stratification of pre- and post-menopausal groups resulted in a similar association. The results show that NP/OP exposure is associated with EMCa.

UT group received 120¬†mg/kg b. wt. of UT extract orally. FP-UT group received both FP and UT (9.7 and 120¬†mg/kg b.wt, respectively) for 30 days. Hematological parameters, malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), estradiol, histamine and immunoglobulin E (IGE) were assayed. Histopathological and electron microscopical examinations were performed to the lymphoid organs. Hematological parameters, were decreased in the FP group than the control group. There was a rise in MDA of FP group followed by a decrease in TAC content with histological and ultrastructure degenerative changes. UT extract treatment ameliorated the FP-induced perturbations for the former parameters. The results showed that FP treatment exerted an immunotoxic effect through acting as an endocrine disruptor and allergic, pro-inflammatory that was confirmed by histopathological and ultrastructure study of the lymphoid organs. Uncaria tomentosa extract could successfully modulate FP-induced immunotoxicity by diminishing all the studied parameters.",,,"Circadian Rhythm,Energy Intake,Gastrointestinal Microbiome,Humans,Obesity,Postprandial Period,Sleep Deprivation"
32411914,-89,,,Di-(2-ethylhexyl) Phthalate (DEHP) and Uterine Histological Characteristics.,"Phthalates have a long industrial history. It is suspected that phthalates and their metabolites have detrimental effects on reproduction and development. They are well-known for their anti-androgenic effects. Several studies have indicated that phthalates and their metabolites are reprotoxic in males and endocrine disruptors. Reproduction and embryogenesis occur in the uterus of female eutherian mammals. A horizontal analytical method is preferred to elucidate the toxic effects of phthalates on human reproduction. Nevertheless, there are vast numbers of known phthalates and not all of their modes of action have been clarified. Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a commonly used plasticizer and has been the subject of numerous toxicological studies. However, few of these have reported on the toxic effects of DEHP, its metabolites, other phthalates, or mixtures on female reproduction. Acute and high doses of DEHP adversely affect uterine histology. Recently, it was disclosed that chronic exposures to low doses of DEHP have endocrine disruption efficacy. DEHP induces various cellular responses including modulation of the expression and regulation of steroid hormone receptors and transcription and paracrine factors. Uteri do not respond uniformly to DEHP exposure. The phenotypic manifestations and effects on fertility in response to DEHP and its metabolites may vary with species, developmental stage, and generation. Hence, DEHP exposure may histological alter the uterus and induce endometriosis, endometriosis, hyperplasia, myoma, and developmental and reproductive toxicity.",,"Androgen,Corticosterone,Cortisol,Estrogen,Reproduction,Stress,Suprachiasmatic","Circadian Rhythm,Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System,Neurosecretory Systems,Pituitary-Adrenal System"

36460192,-89,,,Effects of benzo[a]pyrene on the reproductive axis: Impairment of kisspeptin signaling in human gonadotropin-releasing hormone primary neurons.,"The neuroendocrine control of reproduction is strictly coordinated at the central level by the pulsatile release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) by the hypothalamic GnRH neurons. Alterations of the GnRH-network, especially during development, lead to long-term reproductive and systemic consequences, also causing infertility. Recent evidence shows that benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), a diffuse pollutant that can play a role as an endocrine disruptor, affects gonadal function and gamete maturation, whereas data demonstrating its impact at hypothalamic level are very scarce. This study investigated the effects of BaP (10¬†ŒºM) in a primary cell culture isolated from the human fetal hypothalamus (hfHypo) and exhibiting a clear GnRH neuron phenotype. BaP significantly decreased gene and protein expression of both GnRH and kisspeptin receptor (KISS1R), the master regulator of GnRH neuron function. Moreover, BaP exposure increased phospho-ERK1/2 signaling, a well-known mechanism associated with KISS1R activation. Interestingly, BaP altered the electrophysiological membrane properties leading to a significant depolarizing effect and it also significantly increased GnRH release, with both effects being not affected by kisspeptin addition. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that BaP may alter GnRH neuron phenotype and function, mainly interfering with KISS1R signaling and GnRH secretion and therefore with crucial mechanisms implicated in the central neuroendocrine control of reproduction.",,"Endocrine disruptors,Mitochondria,Receptors, aryl hydrocarbon,Renal insufficiency, chronic","Cohort Studies,Humans,Kidney,Mitochondria,Odds Ratio,Prospective Studies"
35954780,-89,,,Prenatal Environmental Exposure to Persistent Organic Pollutants and Reproductive Hormone Profile and Pubertal Development in Dutch Adolescents.,"Persistent organic pollutants (POPs), such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), may interfere with hormonal processes. Knowledge about the effects of prenatal exposure to PCBs and their hydroxylated metabolites (OH-PCBs) on pubertal development is limited. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to determine whether prenatal environmental PCB and OH-PCB exposure are associated with reproductive hormone levels and pubertal characteristics in 13- to 15-year-old children. In this Dutch observational cohort study, 194 mother-infant pairs were included (1998-2002). Maternal pregnancy serum levels of PCBs, OH-PCBs, and other POPs were measured. At follow-up (2014-2016), we measured serum or plasma levels of reproductive hormones in their children. We assessed Tanner stages and testicular volume (by clinician or standardized self-assessment), and participants completed questionnaires on pubertal onset. In total, 101 adolescents (14.4 ¬± 0.8 years; 53.7% of invited) participated, and 55 were boys. In boys, higher prenatal PCB levels were associated with higher testosterone levels, higher pubic hair stage, larger testicular volume, and younger age at onset of growth spurt and voice break. In girls, higher prenatal PCB levels were associated with higher stages for breast development. In conclusion, higher prenatal PCB exposure could be associated with more advanced pubertal development in 13- to 15-year-old children.","Environmental Pollutants,Hormones,Polychlorinated Biphenyls","Biocides,Endocrine disruption,In silico methods,Molecular docking,Nuclear receptors,QSAR","Computer Simulation,Endocrine Disruptors,Endocrine System,Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear,Software"

Structurally diverse chemical substances are capable to bind to VDR and PPARŒ≥, consequently acting in agonistic or antagonistic mode. Ubiquitous triorganotin compounds, key components of antifouling, disinfectant and biocidal agents were found to act as cognate ligands of several nuclear receptors.

In this study, we have investigated agonistic as well as antagonistic effects of selected triorganotin compounds on VDR and PPARŒ≥ in transgenic gene reporter IZ-VDRE and PAZ-PPARŒ≥ human cell lines, allowing rapid and sensitive assessment of receptor transcriptional activity. We demonstrated that most of investigated triorganotins at nanomolar concentration exerted significant agonistic effects on VDR with fold activation ranging from 2.0 to 3.0-fold as well as some significant changes ranging from 127 to 199% of the maximal 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) induction, in antagonistic mode.

A case-control study in Chinese population was conducted to evaluate the association between BPA exposure and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and explore the interaction between BPA exposure and estrogen-related genetic polymorphism on NSCLC. BPA concentrations were measured in urine samples using an UHPLC-MS method and rs2046210 in estrogen receptor Œ± (ESR1) gene was genotyped by TaqMan genotyping system. Logistic regression was performed to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the association analyses. As a result, 615 NSCLC cases and 615 healthy controls were enrolled from Wuhan, central China. The mean age was 58.0 (SD: 7.9) years old for controls and 59.2 (SD: 8.8) years old for cancer cases. The creatinine-adjusted BPA levels were significantly higher in NSCLC cases than that in healthy controls (median: 0.97 vs 0.73¬†Œºg/L, P¬†<¬†0.001). Exposure to high levels of BPA was significantly associated with NSCLC (adjusted OR¬†=¬†1.91, 95%CI: 1.39-2.62, P¬†<¬†0.001 for the highest quartile). We also observed a shallow concave dose-response relationship about the overall association between BPA and NSCLC.

In this study, functional assays in vitro and mouse models in vivo were used to evaluate the toxic effects of long-term exposure to environmental concentrations of BDE209 on the pathogenesis and progression of PTC. MTS, EdU and colony-forming assays confirmed the chronic toxicity of BDE209 on the proliferation of human normal follicular epithelial cell line (Nthy-ori 3-1) and PTC-derived cell lines (TPC-1 and BCPAP). Wound and Transwell assays showed that BDE209 exacerbated the aggressiveness of PTC cells. BDE209 significantly promoted cell proliferation during the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. Mechanistically, BDE209 altered the thyroid system by acting as a competitive inhibitor of thyroid receptor beta (TR√ü) expression and function, which was further proven by public databases and RNA-seq bioinformation analysis. Taken together, these results demonstrated that BDE209 has chronic toxicity and potential tumourigenic effects on the thyroid by inhibiting TR√ü.",,"Aquatic environments,Emerging contaminants,Numerical modelling,Transport and fate,Water resources","Cosmetics,Ecosystem,Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Monitoring,Humans,Pharmaceutical Preparations,Water Pollutants, Chemical"
35536153,-89,,,Environmental Exposure to 6:2 Polyfluoroalkyl Phosphate Diester and Impaired Testicular Function in Men.,"6:2 polyfluoroalkyl phosphate diester (6:2 diPAP) has been demonstrated to disrupt reproductive endocrine functions using experimental studies. However, evidence from humans is not available yet. This cross-sectional study aims to assess the relationship between 6:2 diPAP exposure and the testicular function among adult men. A total of 902 men seeking preconception care were included. Plasma 6:2 diPAP concentrations were determined, while the testicular function was assessed via semen quality and reproductive hormones in serum. The association was assessed by multiple linear regression. Stratified analyses by age and body mass index (BMI) were conducted to assess the potential effect modification by these two variables. Regression analyses revealed that 6:2 diPAP exposure was significantly inversely associated with androgens [i.e., total testosterone (TT) and free androgen index (FAI)], markers of testosterone production potential [i.e., TT/luteinizing hormone (LH) and FAI/LH], estradiol, and insulin-like factor 3, a biomarker of Leydig cell function. These associations were robust in sensitivity analyses. However, age and BMI did not modify these associations, and no association was observed between 6:2 diPAP and semen quality. Our study suggests that exposure to 6:2 diPAP may inhibit androgen synthesis and impair Leydig cell function in adult men.","Androgens,Organophosphates,Phosphates,Testosterone,Luteinizing Hormone","Catalyst,Endocrine-disrupting compounds,Non-thermal plasma,Pharmaceuticals and personal care products,Water treatment","Cosmetics,Endocrine Disruptors,Pharmaceutical Preparations,Plasma Gases,Water Pollutants, Chemical"
35781563,-89,,,Bisphenol-A impairs synaptic formation and function by RGS4-mediated regulation of BDNF signaling in the cerebral cortex.,"Bisphenol-A (BPA) is a representative endocrine disruptor, widely used in a variety of products including plastics, medical equipment and receipts. Hence, most people are exposed to BPA via the skin, digestive system or inhalation in everyday life. Furthermore, BPA crosses the blood-brain barrier and is linked to multiple neurological dysfunctions found in neurodegenerative and neuropsychological disorders. However, the mechanisms underlying BPA-associated neurological dysfunctions remain poorly understood. Here, we report that BPA exposure alters synapse morphology and function in the cerebral cortex. Cortical pyramidal neurons treated with BPA showed reduced size and number of dendrites and spines. The density of excitatory synapses was also decreased by BPA treatment. More importantly, we found that BPA disrupted normal synaptic transmission and cognitive behavior. RGS4 and its downstream BDNF/NTRK2 pathway appeared to mediate the effect of BPA on synaptic and neurological function. Our findings provide molecular mechanistic insights into anatomical and physiological neurotoxic consequences related to a potent endocrine modifier.","Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor,Endocrine Disruptors","Aquatic ecosystem,Endocrine disruption,Human population,Thyroid,UV filters","Cosmetics,Environmental Monitoring,Female,Humans,Sunscreening Agents"

Regulatory restrictions have been established to prevent risks for human health, leading to BPA substitution by structural analogues, like BPS and BPF. We previously demonstrated that oral perinatal exposure to BPA had long-term consequences on immune responses later in life. It appears now essential to enhance our understanding on immune impact of different routes of BP exposure. In this study, we aimed at comparing the impact of mother dermal exposure to BPs on offspring immune system at adulthood. Gravid mice were dermally exposed to BPA, BPS or BPF at 5 or 50¬†Œºg/kg of body weight (BW)/day (d) from gestation day 15 to weaning of pups at post-natal day (PND)21. In offspring, BPs dermal impregnation of mothers led to adverse effects on immune response at intestinal and systemic levels that was dependent on the BP, the dose and offspring sex. These findings provide, for the first time, results on long-term consequences of dermal perinatal BPs exposure on immune responses in offspring. This work warns that it is mandatory to consider immune markers, dose exposure as well as sex in risk assessment associated with new BPA's alternatives.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Estrogens, Non-Steroidal,Phenols,Sulfones,bisphenol F,bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)sulfone,bisphenol A","Endocrine-disrupting effects,Estrogen receptors,In vitro assays,Molecular dynamics simulations,Parabens","Cosmetics,Environmental Pollutants,Estrone,Humans,Parabens,Receptors, Estrogen"

In fact, DEHP is extensively used in food cosmetics and medical packaging. It has become a serious problem in recent years. DEHP can be absorbed into the human body through the air, food, water, and skin. The current study involved intraperitoneal injection of DEHP dissolved in corn oil once daily for 21 consecutive days to investigate the effects of DEHP on the thyroid and the reproductive system in female rats. Results show that ovarian hormones (progesterone and estrogen) decreased significantly in the rats treated with DEHP compared to control. This result is supported by the alteration of folliculogenesis, the decrease of the follicles viability, and the apoptosis of the granulosa cells observed on histological sections of ovary and thyroid in female rats exposed to low doses of DEHP. Histopathological study revealed that DEHP could damage thyroid tissue and disrupt these functions. We also observed cellular damage, particularly in the liver cells, and a significant increase in biochemical parameters such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) compared to the control group.","Endocrine Disruptors,Phthalic Acids,phthalic acid,Polyvinyl Chloride,Diethylhexyl Phthalate","Biomonitoring,Endocrine disrupting chemicals,Exposure,Parabens,Pregnant women,Urine","Cosmetics,Female,Humans,Iran,Parabens,Pregnancy,Preservatives, Pharmaceutical,Seasons"

21377254,-88,,,Potential mechanisms of phthalate ester embryotoxicity in the abalone Haliotis diversicolor supertexta.,"The effects and associated toxicological mechanisms of five phthalate esters (PAEs) on abalone embryonic development were investigated by exposing the embryos to a range of PAEs concentrations (0.05, 0.2, 2 and 10 g/mL). The results showed that PAEs could significantly reduce embryo hatchability, increase developmental malformations, and suppress the metamorphosis of abalone larvae. The possible toxicological mechanisms of PAEs to abalone embryos included, affecting the Na+-K+-pump and Ca2+-Mg2+-pump activities, altering the peroxidase (POD) level and the malondialdehyde (MDA) production, damaging the extraembryonic membranes structure, as well as disrupting endocrine-related genes (gpx, cyp3a, and 17-hsd 12) expression properties. Taken together, this work showed that PAEs adversely affected the embryonic ontogeny of abalone. The abilities of PAEs affecting the osmoregulation, inducing oxidative stress, damaging embryo envelope structure, and causing physiological homeostasis disorder, are likely to be a part of the common mechanisms responsible for their embryonic toxicity.","Esters,Phthalic Acids,Teratogens","allostatic load,anxiety symptoms,depressive symptoms,exercise,mindfulness,perinatal mental health,stress relief,therapeutic writing","COVID-19,Complementary Therapies,Female,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Mental Health,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Complications,Pregnancy Outcome,Psychotherapy,SARS-CoV-2,Stress, Psychological"
36332405,-88,,,Endocrine disrupting potential of selected azole and organophosphorus pesticide products through suppressing the dimerization of human androgen receptor in genomic pathway.,"Several pesticides widely used in agriculture have been considered to be endocrine disrupting chemicals through their binding affinities to estrogen or androgen receptors. This study was conducted to clarify the human androgen receptor (hAR)-mediated genomic endocrine disrupting mechanism of eight selected pesticide products by in vitro assay providing the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Test Guideline No. 458, 22Rv1/MMTV_GR-KO AR transcriptional activation assay and a homo-dimerization confirmation assay. None of the tested pesticide products showed an AR agonistic effect, whereas they were all determined to be AR antagonists at non-toxic concentrations. Also, the eight pesticide products were verified as true AR antagonists through a specificity control test. In the Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer-based AR homo-dimerization confirmation assay, the eight pesticide products did not induce AR homo-dimerization. Additionally, western blotting revealed that none of the eight pesticide products induced AR translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. In conclusion, we found for the first-time evidence to understand the AR-mediated endocrine disrupting mechanisms induced by selected azole and organophosphorus pesticide products.","Receptors, Androgen,Organophosphorus Compounds,Azoles,Pesticides","Consensus,Endocrine disease,Expert opinion,Pandemic,Qualtrics,Survey","COVID-19,Consensus,Expert Testimony,Humans,Pandemics,SARS-CoV-2"

Exposure to BFRs has been associated with effects on endocrine homeostasis. To test the hypothesis that in utero and lactational exposure to BFRs may affect the reproductive system of female offspring, adult female Sprague Dawley rats were fed diets formulated to deliver nominal doses (0, 0.06, 20, or 60‚Äâmg/kg/day) of a BFR dietary mixture mimicking the relative congener levels in house dust from prior to mating until weaning. Vaginal opening and the day of first estrus occurred at a significantly earlier age among offspring from the 20‚Äâmg/kg/day BFR group, indicating that the onset of puberty was advanced. Histological analysis of ovaries from postnatal day 46 offspring revealed an increase in the incidence of abnormal follicles. A toxicogenomic analysis of ovarian gene expression identified upstream regulators, including HIF1A, CREB1, EGF, the Œ≤-estradiol, and PPARA pathways, predicted to be downregulated in the 20 or 60‚Äâmg/kg/day group and to contribute to the gene expression patterns observed.

Timing of puberty is a strongly heritable trait. However, large genetic association studies can only explain a fraction of the observed variability and striking secular trends suggest that lifestyle and/or environmental factors are important. Using liquid-chromatography tandem-mass-spectrometry, we measured endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs; triclosan, bisphenol A, benzophenone-3, 2,4-dichlorophenol, 11 metabolites from 5 phthalates) in longitudinal urine samples obtained biannually from peri-pubertal children included in the COPENHAGEN puberty cohort. EDC levels were associated with blood DNA methylation profiles from 31 boys and 20 girls measured both pre- and post-pubertally. We found little evidence of single methylation sites that on their own showed association with urinary excretion levels of EDCs obtained either the same-day or measured as the yearly mean of dichotomized EDC levels. In contrast, methylation of several promoter regions was found to be associated with two or more EDCs, overlap with known gene-chemical interactions, and form a core network with genes known to be important for puberty. Furthermore, children with the highest yearly mean of dichotomized urinary phthalate metabolite levels were associated with higher promoter methylation of the thyroid hormone receptor interactor 6 gene (TRIP6), which again was mirrored by lower circulating TRIP6 protein levels. In general, the mean TRIP6 promoter methylation was mirrored by circulating TRIP6 protein levels.

36235091,-88,,,Assessment of the Effects of Triticonazole on Soil and Human Health.,"Triticonazole is a fungicide used to control diseases in numerous plants. The commercial product is a racemate containing (R)- and (S)-triticonazole and its residues have been found in vegetables, fruits, and drinking water. This study considered the effects of triticonazole on soil microorganisms and enzymes and human health by taking into account the enantiomeric structure when applicable. An experimental method was applied for assessing the effects of triticonazole on soil microorganisms and enzymes, and the effects of the stereoisomers on soil enzymes and human health were assessed using a computational approach. There were decreases in dehydrogenase and phosphatase activities and an increase in urease activity when barley and wheat seeds treated with various doses of triticonazole were sown in chernozem soil. At least 21 days were necessary for the enzymes to recover the activities. This was consistent with the diminution of the total number of soil microorganisms in the 14 days after sowing. Both stereoisomers were able to bind to human plasma proteins and were potentially inhibitors of human cytochromes, revealing cardiotoxicity and low endocrine disruption potential. As distinct effects, (R)-TTZ caused skin sensitization, carcinogenicity, and respiratory toxicity. There were no significant differences in the interaction energies of the stereoisomers and soil enzymes, but (S)-TTZ exposed higher interaction energies with plasma proteins and human cytochromes.","Cyclopentanes,Cytochromes,Drinking Water,Fungicides, Industrial,Soil,Soil Pollutants,Triazoles,triticonazole,Oxidoreductases,Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases,Urease","ToxCast database,chemical prioritization,endocrine-active pesticides,stochastic human exposure and dose simulation high-throughput model (SHEDS-HT),toxicological prioritization index (ToxPi)","Crops, Agricultural,Endocrine Disruptors,Endocrine System,High-Throughput Screening Assays,Humans,Pesticides,Risk Assessment"

Cu exposure decreased significantly cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. Cu and Pb negatively affected in vitro decidualization, showing a significant decrease in PRL secretion. HOXA10 and ERŒ± mRNA levels significantly decreased in decidualized cells (dEnSCs) exposed to Cu. Cu and Pb decreased adhesion and regeneration capability in EnEC. This study reveals that Cu and Pb could negatively affect endometrial functionality, compromising the decidualization process and disrupting endometrial regeneration and embryo adhesion.

20136073,-88,,,Transcriptional effects of prenatal and neonatal exposure to PFOS in developing rat brain.,"Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), a persistent and bioaccumulative compound, is widely distributed in the environment. To explore the molecular mechanism of neonatal neurotoxic effects, we evaluated the transcriptional effects of prenatal and neonatal exposure to PFOS in developing rat brain by performing gene expression profiling in the cerebral cortex. Dams received 3.2 mg/kg PFOS in their feed from gestational day 1 (GD1) to weaning (PND 21). Pups then had free access to treated feed until PND 35. Six Illumina RatRef-12 Expression BeadChips were used to identify gene expression changes on postnatal days (PNDs) 1, 7, and 35. Significantly affected genes (P < 0.05) were involved in neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, calcium signaling pathways, cell communication, long-term potentiation/depression, the cell cycle, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling. To compare prenatal and lactational exposure contributions to transcriptional effects, a subset of altered genes obtained from the gene-profile study that represented neurobiological functions was analyzed using RT-PCR in a follow-up cross-foster study lasting from PND1 to 21. Prenatal and postnatal exposure to PFOS caused potential neurotoxicity as demonstrated by developmentally different global transcriptional changes. Prenatal exposure was more effective in altering expression of several genes. Also, transcriptional effects of PFOS exposure on neurodevelopment occurred primarily by disrupting the neuroendocrine system.","Alkanesulfonic Acids,Fluorenes,Fluorocarbons,Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors,poly(9,9-di-n-octyl-2,7-fluorene),perfluorooctane sulfonic acid","EWAS,Endocrine disrupting chemicals,Environmental exposure,Epigenome","Cross-Sectional Studies,DNA,DNA Methylation,Female,Flame Retardants,Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry,Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers,Humans,Methylation"

We then examined whether mating these males to unexposed females altered  embryo characteristics. Atrazine exposure caused a decrease in liver weight and changes in both liver and testis gene expression, specifically in genes involved in lipid uptake and fatty acid metabolism in the liver, as well as androgen conversion in the testis. Notably, atrazine exposure decreased epididymal sperm concentration and subsequent embryo cell numbers generated from the 12-week cohort males.

Thyroid hormones play key roles in nervous system development and can exert influence on various immune cells contributing to pathophysiological conditions. Octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC) is one of the most commonly used UV filters, and  and  studies have found thyroid disrupting effects. The present study assessed whether OMC administration in mice dams during the lactational period can cause thyroid disruption and generate immunologic alterations in the offspring. Indirect exposure to the OMC (1,000 mg/kg) in the lactational period affected neurodevelopment parameters, such as delayed eye-opening and weight gain in mice of both sexes, and these alterations are corroborated by the decrease in the T4 levels present in the pups' blood. No significant changes were observed in the thymus of these pups, but the number of lymphocytes increased in the spleen of the animals exposed to OMC, similar to the animals treated with propyl-thiouracil (PTU), a well-known thyroid disruptor. OMC modulated the percentage of leukocyte populations in peripheral blood, and the number of circulating polymorphonuclear cells increased two-fold. , OMC exhibited an inhibitory effect on splenocyte proliferation and IL-2 production induced by anti-CD3 antibody; however, this effect was reversed with the addition of T4 in the cell culture. In summary, the results of the present study demonstrate the influence of OMC on thyroid dysregulation and its impact on the modulation of the immune system in mice pups.""}",,,"Cross-Sectional Studies,Humans,Hypothyroidism,Insulin,Liver Diseases,Male,Thyroid Hormones"
35504341,-88,,,Levels and health risks of urinary phthalate metabolites and the association between phthalate exposure and unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion: a large case-control study from China.,"Phthalate acid esters (PAEs) are environmental endocrine disruptors that can interfere with endocrine processes and cause adverse reproductive outcomes. The link between PAE exposure and unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion (URSA) remains unknown. In this study, nine urinary metabolites of PAEs (mPAEs) were measured in 594 URSA cases and 569 healthy controls. The measured mPAEs were ubiquitously detected and present at higher levels (median: 203¬†ng/mL) in the URSA cases than in the controls (median: 161¬†ng/mL). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that URSA was associated with higher concentrations of mono (2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (mEHHP), mono (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (mEHP), and mono-ethyl phthalate (mEP) and lower concentrations of mono-isobutyl phthalate (miBP). Moreover, a quantile-based g-computation (QGC) model revealed a positive association between mPAEs mixture and URSA. The URSA cases showed significantly higher concentrations of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) than the controls. This was consistent with the health risk assessment, which suggested that DEHP is the main contributors to potential non-carcinogenic risk. DEHP accounted for over 80% of total risk. The large case-control study results suggest that PAE exposure may increase the risk of URSA, and that policy-makers and public health experts should pay more attention to DEHP exposure.","Environmental Pollutants,Esters,Phthalic Acids,phthalic acid,Diethylhexyl Phthalate","Endocrine disruptors,Gastrointestinal microbiome,Receptors, thyroid hormone,Thyroglobulin,Thyroid neoplasm","Cryoelectron Microscopy,Humans,Signal Transduction,Thyroid Diseases,Thyroid Gland,Thyroid Neoplasms"

However, few studies have examined the association between phenol exposure, including bisphenol A (BPA), benzophenone-3 (BP-3), and triclosan, and the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). This cross-sectional study utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2003-2012). Urinary BPA, BP-3, and triclosan were measured with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The CVD was defined as a composite of 5 self-reported cardiovascular outcomes, including congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, angina pectoris, heart attack or stroke. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the association between phenols and the prevalence of CVD. A total of 8164 participants were enrolled, and 740 (9.1%) were diagnosed of CVD. The average levels of BPA, BP-3, and triclosan concentrations were 3.38, 202.63, and 99.27¬†ng/mL respectively. Per 1-unit increasement in log-transformed urinary BPA was associated with increased risk of CVD after adjusting all covariates (odds ratio [OR] 1.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01 to 1.18, P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05). Compared with the lowest quartile (<‚Äâ0.9), the multivariable-adjusted OR was 1.30 (1.03 to 1.65, P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05) in the highest quartile (>‚Äâ3.8).

34808557,-88,,,Single-cell transcriptome analysis of Bisphenol A exposure reveals the key roles of the testicular microenvironment in male reproduction.,"Testicular development during juvenile is crucial for subsequent male reproductive function. However, it remains poorly understood about the contribution of the testis microenvironment to human germ cell maturation. Therefore, we systematically analyzed scRNA-seq transcriptome and found the dramatic changes in cell-type composition in human testis during puberty. Then we constructed cell-cell communication networks between germ cells and somatic cells in the juvenile testis, which may be achieved via immune-related pathways. Our results showed that maturation-promoting factors are the switches of the Sertoli cells that drive sperm maturation. Furthermore, we found that Bisphenol A(BPA) enhanced the maturation and growth of germ cells through the Sertoli cell's secretory protein. Finally, our results indicate Bisphenol A would lead to the dysregulation of secreted protein expression in Sertoli cells during spermatogenesis, which in turn has direct cytotoxicity to Sertoli cells. Bisphenol A is one of the underlying causes of non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA). In summary, our results reveal the reproductive toxicity and molecular mechanism of Bisphenol A in Sertoli cells and male reproduction. Provide a reference for the toxicity of Bisphenol A to human reproduction.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Phenols,bisphenol A","ecotoxicity,human toxicity,stereospecificity","Cyclopentanes,Cytochromes,Drinking Water,Fungicides, Industrial,Humans,Oxidoreductases,Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases,Soil,Soil Microbiology,Soil Pollutants,Triazoles,Urease"
33297156,-88,,,Effects of pubertal exposure to low doses of di-(2-ethylexyl)phthalate on reproductive behaviors in male mice.,"Reproductive behaviors are tightly regulated by sex steroid hormones. Interference with these hormones or their neural signaling pathways leads to behavioral alterations. We have previously shown that oral exposure of adult male mice to di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), an organic environmental endocrine disruptor, altered sexual behavior. In this study, we examined the effects of pubertal exposure to DEHP and analyzed whether pubertal and adult exposures to DEHP trigger long-term effects. For pubertal exposure, male mice were exposed orally to the vehicle or DEHP at 5 or 50¬†Œºg/kg/d from postnatal day (PND) 30 to PND60. Exposure was arrested and animals were analyzed on PND120. They exhibited normal olfactory preference but showed modified emission of ultrasonic vocalizations. DEHP exposure also affected partner preference and mating components. These modifications were associated with normal circulating testosterone levels and weight of androgen-sensitive tissues. In contrast, androgen receptor (AR) protein amount was reduced in the hypothalamic preoptic area in particular for the DEHP-50 group. Pubertal exposure also increased the anxiety-state level without changing circadian activity. When adult male mice were exposed to DEHP at the same doses from PND60 to PND105 and analyzed two months later, no effects of treatment on reproductive and anxiety-related behaviors or hypothalamic AR protein amount were seen. Our data show that pubertal exposure of male mice to DEHP induces long-term behavioral changes in contrast to the adult exposure. This highlights the sensitivity of the nervous system to low doses of DEHP during the critical period of puberty.","Endocrine Disruptors,Phthalic Acids,phthalic acid,Diethylhexyl Phthalate","AG1024,Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR),CYP1A enzyme,Insulin receptor (IR),Insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R)","Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1,Receptor, Insulin,Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon,Tyrphostins"

But the contaminations of REEs in the e-waste sites and the related health effects were barely investigated. In the present study, we analyzed the concentrations of REEs and the hormones of the HPT axis in plasma of subjects recruited from an e-waste area and a reference area in Taizhou, China. The results showed that the concentrations of several REEs like La, Ce were much higher in the exposed group than in the control group (all p¬†<¬†0.001). The thyroid hormones, FT3 and FT4, and TRH showed no significant difference between the two groups, while the concentration of TSH was significantly higher in the exposed group when compared to the control group (p¬†=¬†0.002). Separate regression analysis indicated that elevated La and Ce levels were associated with higher TSH concentrations. MDA and 8-iso, the biomarkers of oxidative stress, were also significantly higher in the exposed group than that of the control group (p¬†=¬†0.002 and p¬†=¬†0.003, respectively). The increased oxidative stress might be the mechanism underlying the disruptive effects of REEs on TSH. Our results indicated that the quantities of internal exposure of REEs in the subjects in the e-waste area were considerable and the compositional profile of the REEs in the exposed group was different from the control group due to the e-waste dismantling. The expression of TSH were also affected by high La and Ce exposure which showed an endocrine disruption effects of REEs on HPT axis.","Biomarkers,Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Pollutants,Hormones,Metals, Rare Earth,Thyroid Hormones","AP-1,MUC5AC,NF-Œ∫B,o,p‚Äô-DDT","DDT,Epithelial Cells,Humans,Insecticides,Lung,Mucin 5AC,NF-kappa B,Transcription Factor AP-1"
34634736,-88,,,Evidence of melatonin ameliorative effects on the blood-testis barrier and sperm quality alterations induced by cadmium in the rat testis.,"Herein, we further document the protective action of melatonin (MLT) in mitigating cadmium (Cd) effects on adult rat testis. Cd treatment provoked testicular injury, that was documented by histological and biomolecular alterations, i.e., decrease of serum and testicular testosterone concentration and modified sperm parameters. Mainly, both the cytoarchitecture of the blood-testis barrier (BTB) and germ cell morphology were perturbed, as highlighted by impairment in structural (OCN, VANGL, Cx43) and regulative (Src and FAK) protein levels and/or activation. The study focused on the involvement of the autophagy pathway, that was enhanced especially in the Sertoli cells, probably in response to the disorganization of the BTB. Results obtained with the MLT co-treatment demonstrated that its administration decreased the level of oxidative damage caused by Cd, with reversal of all the observed changes. Moreover, the beneficial effects of MLT alone were evidenced by an increase of sperm quality, in term of motility and DNA integrity. The combined results, obtained in rat, strongly encourage to consider a role for MLT in improving also human testicular health, not only in men exposed to Cd, but also in those having fertility disorders, to ameliorate sperm quality and, consequently, reproductive success.","Cadmium,Melatonin",,"Depression,Female,Glucocorticoids,Humans,Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System,Male,Pituitary-Adrenal System,Receptors, Glucocorticoid"

Recently, it has been shown that BPA may also affect miRNAs expression. Herein, we aimed to evaluate the association of BPA levels with steroid hormone concentration and circulating miRNAs levels to investigate the potential direct effect of BPA on homeostasis in the testis environment. The level of BPA in the seminal plasma of azoospermic men was significantly higher compared to the healthy control. The concentrations of estradiol (E2) and androstenedione (A) were significantly decreased in the seminal plasma of azoospermic men compared to the normospermic men. The levels of miR-let-7a, miR-let-7b, and miR-let-7c were significantly up-regulated, and the level of miR-518f was significantly down-regulated in the seminal plasma of the azoospermic men compared to the healthy control. The level of BPA correlated negatively with sperm concentration and normal semen morphology. A significant positive correlation was found between BPA levels and miR-let-7a and miR-let-7c levels, whereas BPA negatively correlated with miR-518f levels. Our results suggest that BPA may negatively affect sperm quality. Moreover, BPA correlated with the miR-let-7a, miR-let-7c, and miR-518f levels in seminal plasma, which suggests that BPA may act directly in seminal plasma, affecting the testicular environment.",,"Depression,Heterogeneity,Homeostasis,Inflammation,Metabolism,Treatment","Depression,Humans,Leptin,Metabolic Syndrome,Obesity,Weight Gain"
35479511,-88,,,Transcriptome alterations in spermatogonial stem cells exposed to bisphenol A.,"Owing to their self-renewal and differentiation abilities, spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) are essential for maintaining male fertility and species preservation through spermatogenesis. With an increase in exposure to plasticizers, the risk of endocrine-disrupting chemicals exerting mimetic effects on estrogen receptors, such as bisphenol A (BPA), has also increased. This has led to concerns regarding the preservation of male fertility. BPA impairs spermatogenesis and the maintenance of SSCs; however, the transcriptome differences caused by BPA in SSCs are poorly understood. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the transcriptome differences in SSCs exposed to BPA, using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis. We found that cell proliferation and survival were suppressed by SSC exposure to BPA. Therefore, we investigated transcriptome differences through RNA-Seq, functional annotation, and gene set enrichment analysis. Our results showed repetitive and abundant terms related to two genes of lysosomal acidification and five genes of glycosaminoglycan degradation. Furthermore, we validated the transcriptome analyses by detecting mRNA and protein expression levels. The findings confirmed the discovery of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and the mechanism of SSCs following exposure to BPA. Taken together, we expect that the identified DEGs and lysosomal mechanisms could provide new insights into the preservation of male fertility and related research.",,"bisphenols,depression,phthalates,serum levels","Depressive Disorder, Major,Dibutyl Phthalate,Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Exposure,Environmental Pollution,Female,Humans,Male,Phthalic Acids"

36291100,-88,,,Bisphenol Exposure Disrupts Cytoskeletal Organization and Development of Pre-Implantation Embryos.,"The endocrine disrupting activity of bisphenol compounds is well documented, but less is known regarding their impact on cell division and early embryo formation. Here, we tested the effects of acute in vitro exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) and its common substitute, bisphenol F (BPF), during critical stages of mouse pre-implantation embryo development, including the first mitotic division, cell polarization, as well as morula and blastocyst formation. Timing of initial cleavage was determined by live-cell imaging, while subsequent divisions, cytoskeletal organization and lineage marker labeling were assessed by high-resolution fluorescence microscopy. Our analysis reveals that brief culture with BPA or BPF impeded cell division and disrupted embryo development at all stages tested. Surprisingly, BPF was more detrimental to the early embryo than BPA. Notably, poor embryo development was associated with cytoskeletal disruptions of the actomyosin network, apical domain formation during cell polarization, actin ring zippering for embryo sealing and altered cell lineage marker profiles. These results underscore that bisphenols can disrupt cytoskeletal integrity and remodeling that is vital for early embryo development and raise concerns regarding the use of BPF as a 'safe' BPA substitute.","Actins,Actomyosin,bisphenol A,bisphenol F,Benzhydryl Compounds,Phenols",,"Dermatitis, Atopic,Humans,Immunity,Physician-Patient Relations,Pruritus,Psychotherapy,Quality of Life,Stress Disorders, Traumatic,Stress, Psychological"

Both metabolites failed to affect the production of androstenedione and testosterone but increased the secretion of estradiol at all concentrations tested. The increased secretion of estradiol was due to the stimulation of aromatase gene and protein expression. Direct assessment of aromatase activity by dibenzylfluorescein assay and indirect assessment of aromatase activity by measurement of the conversion of testosterone to estradiol confirmed that 5-OH-BDE-47 and 6-OH-BDE-47 stimulate aromatase activity.

We treated 3-week-old male mice with 4.8 mg/kg/day (milligram/kilogram/day) (no observed adverse effect level), 30 mg/kg/day (high exposure dose relative to humans), 100 mg/kg/day (level causing a reproductive system disorder), and 500 mg/kg/day (dose causing a multigenerational reproductive system disorder) of DEHP via gavage. Obvious abnormalities in the testicular organ coefficient, spermatogenic epithelium, and testosterone levels occurred in the 500 mg/kg DEHP group. Ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNA-seq) showed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in each group could enrich reproduction and reproductive process terms according to the gene ontology (GO) results, and coenrichment of metabolism pathway was observed by the Reactome pathway analysis. Through the analysis of common genes in the metabolism pathway, we discovered that DEHP exposure at 4.8 to 500 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg caused the same damages to the prepubertal testis. In general, we identified two key transcriptional biomarkers (fatty acid binding protein 3 (Fabp3) and carboxylesterase (Ces) 1d), which provided new insight into the gene regulatory mechanism associated with DEHP exposure and will contribute to the prediction and diagnosis of prepuberty testis injury caused by DEHP.",Diethylhexyl Phthalate,"autonomic neuropathy,constipation,diarrhoea,digestion,gallstone disease,gastroesophageal reflux,gastrointestinal hormones,gastrointestinal motility,gastroparesis,insulin resistance,obesity","Diabetes Mellitus,Gastrointestinal Diseases,Gastrointestinal Tract,Glucose,Hormones,Humans,Hypoglycemic Agents,Lipids,Quality of Life"

However, the effect of hexachlorobenzene on the reproductive toxicity of male animals is not described in detail. To investigate the toxic effects of hexachlorobenzene in mouse testes, hexachlorobenzene (100, 400 and 1,600¬†mg/kg) is fed to mice. The morphology of the testes was analysed by haematoxylin and eosin staining. We also investigated the expression of biomarkers for oxidative stress. Database screening identified proteins that interact with hexachlorobenzene and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, a weak ligand of hexachlorobenzene. Gene enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction analyses were also performed. Real-time PCR detected the expression levels of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in four different stages of testicular cells. We identified significantly increased activity levels of superoxide dismutase (p¬†<¬†0.05) and catalase (p¬†<¬†0.05) in mouse testes that had been subjected to oxidative damage. The cell thickness and the number of cell layers in the seminiferous tubules had decreased by varying degrees after the hexachlorobenzene treatment. Particularly, cytokines and proteins involved in transcriptional regulation showed enrichment. The highest levels of aryl hydrocarbon receptor expression were detected in the spermatocytic cell line. Hexachlorobenzene exposure caused testicular damage in mice. The toxicity characteristics of hexachlorobenzene were not dose-dependent.","Endocrine Disruptors,Hexachlorobenzene",,"Diagnosis, Differential,Diagnostic Techniques, Endocrine,Endocrine System Diseases,Humans,Patient Selection,Radiography, Interventional,Referral and Consultation"

We investigated the effects of DES, a potent and synthetic estrogen, on apoptosis in the adult. Adult male golden hamsters received an SC injection of DES and were then sacrificed to collect epididymides after 1, 4, or 7 days of treatment. A significant decrease in epididymal weight and an increase in apoptotic cells were shown on the first day after DES injection. Flow cytometry showed that DES treatment (1 mg/kg) for 1, 4, or 7 days induced significant apoptosis both in the caput and the cauda epididymides. Greater numbers of apoptotic cells were detected in the caput than in the cauda at a fixed time after DES treatment. Serum levels of testosterone decreased markedly within 24 hr after DES administration, reaching undetectable levels of 0.1 ng/ml at 4 days and thereafter. These results indicate that DES administration can increase epididymal apoptosis with a decrease in serum testosterone levels. Because DES used to be injected into domestic animals, adult males also have a chance to take this substance through food. Our study indicates that exposure to DES in adults is as toxic as that in the perinatal period.","Estrogens, Non-Steroidal,Testosterone,Diethylstilbestrol","Cumulative risk assessment,Dibutyl phthalate,Human embryonic stem cell test,PPAR pathway,Phthalates,Reference point index method,di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate","Dibutyl Phthalate,Diethylhexyl Phthalate,Embryonic Development,Female,Humans,PPAR gamma,Phthalic Acids,Plasticizers,Pregnancy,Risk Assessment"
35014926,-87,,,Urinary Phytoestrogen Levels Are Associated with Female Hormonal Cancers: An Analysis of NHANES Data From 1999 to 2010.,"Phytoestrogens are plant-derived compounds that are structurally similar to endogenous estrogens. Studies have shown phytoestrogens to have possible health benefits although they could also act as endocrine disruptors. This is particularly relevant for estrogen-dependent cancers since estrogens increase risk of breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancer. Using data from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES), we assessed the associations between urinary phytoestrogens (daidzein, equol, o-Desmethylangolensin (O-DMA), genistein, enterodiol, enterolactone) and breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancer using multivariate logistic regression with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Cancer diagnosis and other characteristics were collected via in-person questionnaires. We found women in the highest tertile for daidzein and enterodiol had over twice the odds of having breast cancer (OR = 2.51, 95% CI 1.44-4.36 for daidzein, OR = 2.78, 95% CI 1.44-5.37 for enterodiol). In addition, women in the highest tertiles for daidzein and genistein had three to four times the odds of having endometrial cancer, respectively (OR = 3.09, 95% CI 1.01-9.49 for daidzein, OR = 4.00, 95% CI 1.38-11.59 for genistein). Overall, phytoestrogens were positively associated with breast and endometrial cancer although the associations varied by phytoestrogen type.

34601267,-87,,,Pubertal exposure to bisphenol-A affects social recognition and arginine vasopressin in the brain of male mice.,"Social recognition is an ability of animals to identify and distinguish conspecifics, which is essential for nearly all social species to establish social relationships. Social recognition provides the basis for a variety of social behaviors. Because of modulated by gonadal hormones, it is possible that social cognition is affected by environmental endocrine disruptors (EEDs). In the present study, after being pubertal exposed to bisphenol A (BPA, 0.04, 0.4, and 4¬†mg/kg) for 18 days, adult male mice did not show significant dishabituation to a novel female stimulus in habituation-dishabituation task. The capacity for discriminating the odors between familiar and novel female urine or between male and female urine was suppressed in BPA-exposed male. In addition, BPA (0.4, 4¬†mg/kg) decreased the number of immunoreaction of AVP (AVP-ir) neurons in both the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and the medial amygdala (MeA), and BPA (0.04, 0.4, 4¬†mg/kg) reduced the level of V1Œ±R in the lateral septum (LS) of adult male. Further, BPA decreased the levels of testosterone (T) in the brain and androgens receptor (AR) in the LS, the amygdala, and BNST, as well the levels of estrogen receptor Œ± and Œ≤ (ERŒ±/Œ≤) in the amygdala and BNST. These results indicate that pubertal exposure to BPA affected the actions of both androgens and estrogens in the brain and inhibited AVP system of social circuits, and these alterations may be associated with impaired social recognition of adult male mice.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Phenols,Arginine Vasopressin,bisphenol A","Cortisol,Diet,Doping,IGF1,SDA,Testosterone","Diet,Humans,Hydrocortisone,Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy,Metabolomics,Testosterone"
34499926,-87,,,Bisphenol A derivatives act as novel coactivator-binding inhibitors for estrogen receptor Œ≤.,"Bisphenol A and its derivatives are recognized as endocrine disruptors based on their complex effects on estrogen receptor (ER) signaling. While the effects of bisphenol derivatives on ERŒ± have been thoroughly evaluated, how these chemicals affect ERŒ≤ signaling is less well understood. Herein, we sought to identify novel ERŒ≤ ligands using a radioligand competitive binding assay to screen a chemical library of bisphenol derivatives. Many of the compounds identified showed intriguing dual activities as both ERŒ± agonists and ERŒ≤ antagonists. Docking simulations of these compounds and ERŒ≤ suggested that they bound not only to the canonical binding site of ERŒ≤ but also to the coactivator binding site located on the surface of the receptor, suggesting that they act as coactivator-binding inhibitors (CBIs).

Previous studies have shown that the reproduction toxicity of BPA could cause severe effects on the mammal oocytes and disturb the quality of mature oocytes. However, the toxic effects of BPA on the organelles of mouse oocytes have not been reported. In this study, to investigate whether BPA can be toxic to the organelles, we used different concentrations of BPA (50, 100, and 200 ŒºM) to culture mouse oocytes . The results showed that 100 ŒºM BPA exposure could significantly decrease the developmental capacity of oocytes. Then, we used the immunofluorescence staining, confocal microscopy, and western blotting to investigate the toxic effects of BPA on the organelles. The results revealed that mitochondrial dysfunction is manifested by abnormal distribution and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. Moreover, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is abnormally distributed which is accompanied by ER stress showing increased expression of GRP78. For the Golgi apparatus, BPA-exposed dose not disorder the Golgi apparatus distribution but caused abnormal structure of Golgi apparatus, which is manifested by the decrease of GM130 protein expression. Moreover, we also found that BPA-exposed led to the damage of lysosome, which were shown by the increase of LAMP2 protein expression. Collectively, our findings demonstrated that the exposure of BPA could damage the normal function of the organelles, which may explain the reduced maturation quality of oocytes.'}",,"Endocrine disruption,Risk characterisation,Testing","Dietary Exposure,Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Pollutants,Humans,Risk Assessment"

We previously identified many compounds with EDC activity in the circulation of obese patients who underwent bariatric surgery. Herein, we analyzed the effects of four of them (aldrin, BDE28, PFOA and PCB153) on two cancer cell lines of hormone-sensitive organs (prostate and breast). Each cell line was exposed to serial dilutions of EDCs from 10 M to 10 M; cytotoxicity and proliferation were monitored using the IncuCyte technology. We showed that none of these EDCs induce cytotoxicity and that PFOA and PCB153, only at very low doses (10 M), increase the proliferation of DU145 (prostate cancer) and MCF7 (breast cancer) cells, while the same effects are observed with high concentrations (10 M) for aldrin or BDE28. Regarding the mechanistic aspects, PFOA uses two different signaling pathways between the two lines (the Akt/mTORC1 and PlexinD1 in MCF7 and DU145, respectively).

BPA was intraperitoneally injected into mice at a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight for 7 consecutive days. After BPA treatment, the histopathology changes of testis were examined. The circulating levels of testosterone (T) and estradiol (E2) were determined. iTRAQ was used to assess the expression levels of DEPs and to reveal potential interactions between different DEPs. Results showed that BPA caused histological damage in testicular tissues. The levels of T and E2 were affected by BPA exposure. The abundances of orosomucoid 1 (Orm1), haptoglobin (Hp), and insulin-like 3 (Insl3) were significantly lower in BPA-treated mice than those in control mice. The expression changes in the above-mentioned proteins were further validated at the protein level using Western blot analysis. We concluded that BPA affects histological morphology of testis and sex hormone productions. The regulation of key proteins (such as Orm1, Hp and Insl3) may reflect that these proteins may serve as important factors in male reproductive disorders caused by BPA, and these proteins are probably biomarkers for infertility caused by endocrine disrupting chemicals.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Phenols,Testosterone,Estradiol,bisphenol A","endocrine disruptors,fibroids,leiomyoma,midlife,phthalates,women","Diethylhexyl Phthalate,Environmental Exposure,Environmental Pollutants,Female,Humans,Leiomyoma,Middle Aged,Phthalic Acids,Prospective Studies,Weight Gain"
36347119,-87,,,Abnormal histone replacement following BPA exposure affects spermatogenesis and fertility sequentially.,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine-disrupting chemical widely distributed in the environment. Its exposure has been linked to male infertility in animals and humans due to its ability to induce epigenetic modification. Despite extensive research confirming the impact of BPA on epigenetic regulation, fundamental concerns about how BPA causes epigenetic changes and the underlying mechanism of BPA on the male reproductive system remain unresolved. Therefore, we sought to investigate the effects of BPA on epigenetic regulation and the histone-to-protamine (PRM) transition, which is fundamental process for male fertility in testes and spermatozoa by exposing male mice to BPA for 6¬†weeks while giving the mice in the control group corn oil by oral gavage. Our results demonstrated that the mRNA levels of the histone family and PRMs were significantly altered by BPA exposure in testes and spermatozoa. Subsequently, core histone proteins, the PRM1/PRM2 ratio, directly linked to male fertility, and transition proteins were significantly reduced. Furthermore, we discovered that BPA significantly caused abnormal histone-to-protamine replacement during spermiogenesis by increased histone variants-related to histone-to-PRM transition. The levels of histone H3 modification in the testes and DNA methylation in spermatozoa were significantly increased. Consequently, sperm concentration/motility/hyperactivation, fertilization, and early embryonic development were adversely affected as a consequence of altered signaling proteins following BPA exposure. To our knowledge, this is the first study to indicate that BPA exposure influences the histone-to-PRM transition via altering epigenetic modification and eventually causing reduced male fertility.",,"Endocrine disruptors chemicals,Environment,Pollutants,Thyroid cancer,Thyroid diseases,Thyroid nodules","Dioxins,Environmental Monitoring,Environmental Pollutants,Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers,Humans,Pesticides,Phenols,Phenyl Ethers,Polybrominated Biphenyls,Polychlorinated Biphenyls,Thyroid Gland,Thyroid Neoplasms"

However, up to now,only few studies focused on their their potential endocrine-disrupting effects (EDEs). In this study, we investigated the endocrine hormonal disorder caused by the fipronil, ethiprole, and flufiprole enantiomers in¬†vitro and in silico approach. Results of the luciferase reporter assay indicated that the enantiomers of fipronil, ethiprole, or flufiprole have shown stereoselective endocrine-disrupting effects. S-(-)-ethiprole and S-(-)-flufiprole have anti-thyroidal disorder effects whereas R-(-)-fipronil, R-(+)-ethiprole, and R-(+)-flufiprole showed anti-estrogenic disorder effects. The results of the molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the happened EDEs could be partially attributed to the enantioselective specific receptor binding affinities. It also suggested that Vander Waals interactions plays an important role in the binding procedure. This study could provide helpful information for the explanation of enantioselectivity in the EDEs of chiral phenylpyrazole pesticides at the molecular level.","Endocrine Disruptors,Insecticides,Pesticides,Pyrazoles,ethiprole,1-(2,6-dichloro-4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-5-(N-(2-methylprop-2-enyl)amino)-4-trifluoromethylsulfinylpyrazole-3-carbonitrile,fipronil","Endocrine disrupting compound (EDC),Health risk assessment,SPE-LC-MS/MS,Tap water,Water security","Drinking Water,Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Monitoring,Hormones,Humans,Pesticides,Pharmaceutical Preparations,Plasticizers,Solid Phase Extraction,Tandem Mass Spectrometry,Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Paraben exposure has gained particular attention in the past decades, owing to its harmful effects on reproductive function. Whether low-dose paraben exposure may cause ovarian damage has been ignored recently. Here, we investigated the effects of chronic low-dose propylparaben (PrPB) exposure on ovarian function. Female C57BL/6J mice were exposed to PrPB at a humanly relevant dose for 8 months. Our results showed that chronic exposure to PrPB at a humanly relevant dose significantly altered the estrus cycle, hormone levels, and ovarian reserve, accelerating ovarian aging in adult mice. These effects are accompanied by oxidative stress enrichment, leading to steroidogenesis dysfunction and acceleration of primordial follicle recruitment. Notably, melatonin supplementation has been shown to protect against PrPB-induced steroidogenesis dysfunction in granulosa cells. Here, we report that daily chronic PrPB exposure may contribute to ovarian aging by altering oxidative stress-mediated JNK and PI3K-AKT signaling regulation, and that melatonin may serve as a pharmaceutical candidate for PrPB-associated ovarian dysfunction.","Parabens,propylparaben","Drinking water,Endocrine disruptor,Human health risk assessment,Pharmaceuticals,Risk quotient,Tap water","Drinking,Drinking Water,Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Exposure,Environmental Monitoring,Humans,Malaysia,Risk Assessment,Water Pollutants, Chemical"

However, whether these analogues are any safer for the central nervous system remains elusive. Here, we investigated behavioral impairments in mice after BPA and BPS exposure from postnatal days 21-49 (P21~P49). Results showed that BPA (0.1 and 1¬†mg/kg/d) and BPS (1¬†mg/kg/d) impaired emotion and social interaction of mice, while low dose exposure (0.1¬†mg/kg/d) induced no observable changes on emotion in mice. The behavioral deficits were accompanied by hyperactivation of the basolateral amygdala (BLA), i.e., dose-dependent increase in neuronal firing rates and local field potential power. In addition, glutamate receptors were up-regulated in the BLA, showing the same activation trend after exposure to different doses of BPA and BPS. Taken together, these findings imply that BPA and BPS cause behavioral impairments in juvenile mice by disrupting local neuronal activation in the BLA. Although BPS exerted less adverse effects on mice than BPA at the low dose, it does not appear to be a safe alternative to BPA in regard to brain function after prolonged high-volume exposure.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Phenols,bisphenol A","endocrine disrupters,food,gut microbiota,metabolic diseases","Dysbiosis,Endocrine Disruptors,Food Analysis,Gastrointestinal Microbiome,Humans,Metabolic Diseases"

33971473,-86,,,Effects of high-dose bisphenol A on the mouse oral mucosa: A possible link with oral cancers.,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine disrupting chemical able to promote hormone-responsive tumors. The major route of BPA contamination being oral, the aim of the present study was to investigate BPA effects on oral cells. Here, we evaluated the impact of sub-chronic in vivo exposure to BPA and its in vitro effects on neoplastic and non-neoplastic oral cells. We evaluated the oral mucosa of mice chronically exposed to BPA (200¬†mg/L). The response of keratinocytes (NOK-SI) and Head and Neck (HN) Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC), HN12 and HN13¬†cell lines to BPA was examined. In vivo, BPA accumulated in oral tissues and caused an increase in epithelial proliferative activity. BPA disrupted the function of keratinocytes by altering pro-survival and proliferative pathways and the secretion of cytokines and growth factors. In tumor cells, BPA induced proliferative, invasive, pro-angiogenic, and epigenetic paths. Our data highlight the harmful effects of BPA on oral mucosa and, tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic cells. Additionally, BPA may be a modifier of oral cancer cell behavior by prompting a functional shift to a more aggressive phenotype.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Phenols,bisphenol A","e-cigarette,fetus,nicotine,smoking,teratogen,tobacco","Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems,Female,Fetal Development,Fetus,Humans,Nicotine,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Complications,Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects,Smoking,Tobacco"
33017704,-86,,,Detrimental effect of Bisphenol S in mouse germ cell cyst breakdown and primordial follicle assembly.,"The female reproductive lifespan is largely determined by the size of primordial follicle pool, which is established in early life. Bisphenol S (BPS), frequently present in plastic products used in daily life, has been demonstrated as an exogenous estrogen-like endocrine disrupting chemical interfering with the endocrine and reproductive systems. However, the molecular mechanisms of its reproductive toxicity remain to be determined. In the present study, we focused on the effect of BPS on the early ovarian folliculogenesis of mice. Our in¬†vivo experiments showed that the treatment with BPS at 2 and 10¬†Œºg/kg body weight/day for 3 days induced abnormal germ cell cyst breakdown and primordial follicle assembly in the mouse ovary, further affecting later ovarian differentiation and reducing oocyte quality. In addition, our in¬†vitro study demonstrated that BPS could interact with estrogen receptors (ERs) to induce phosphorylation of JNKs, which is responsible for reducing oocyte adhesion in cysts. Meanwhile, BPS exposure up-regulated Notch signaling pathway to increase the proliferation of granulosa cells precursors. Our study provided new evidence for the adverse effects of BPS on female reproduction, especially after perinatal exposure, and elucidated how it works.","Phenols,Sulfones,bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)sulfone",,"Electrons,Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry,Malus,Organic Chemicals,Pesticide Residues,Sensitivity and Specificity,Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"

In a 20-day inpatient study, male cocaine abusers (d-FEN: n=10; bromocriptine: n=8) self-administered smoked cocaine (12-50 mg) for 3 days followed by 2 weeks of abstinence. The acute effects of d-FEN (0 or 30 mg po) or bromocriptine (0 or 1.25 mg po) on plasma neuroendocrine levels were determined 1-2, 7-8, and 13-14 days after the last cocaine dose. Blood was drawn before and then every 30-60 min for 4 h after capsule administration. The effects of d-FEN and bromocriptine were also determined in healthy, outpatient controls; d-FEN was removed from medical use in the US midway through the study due to complications associated with chronic administration, so all of the control participants were tested in Italy. Cocaine users had a blunted prolactin and cortisol response to d-FEN that lasted for at least 2 weeks of cocaine abstinence, but had a normal response to bromocriptine, which suppressed prolactin by 50% of baseline. The long-lasting and selective disruptions in serotonin pathways following chronic cocaine use may provide a neurochemical basis for changes in mood commonly reported during cocaine withdrawal.","Crack Cocaine,Fenfluramine,Bromocriptine,Prolactin,Hydrocortisone",,"Electroretinography,Fluorescein Angiography,Humans,Male,Quality of Life,Tomography, Optical Coherence,Visual Acuity,Vitamin A Deficiency"
33435542,-86,,,Preliminary Investigation on the Ameliorative Role Exerted by D-Aspartic Acid in Counteracting Ethane Dimethane Sulfonate (EDS) Toxicity in the Rat Testis.,"Herein is reported the first evidence of the protective role of D-aspartic acid (D-Asp) in preventing the toxic effect exerted by the alkylating agent ethane dimethane sulfonate (EDS) in the rat testis. We confirmed that EDS treatment specifically destroyed Leydig cells (LC), resulting in the drastic decrease of the serum testosterone level and producing morphological changes in the germinal tubules, i.e., altered organization of the epithelium, loss of cell contacts and the consequent presence of empty spaces between them, and a reduce number of spermatozoa. Moreover, an increase of TUNEL-positive germ cells, other than alteration in the protein level and localization of two LC ""markers"", StAR and PREP, were observed. Interestingly, results obtained from rats pre-treated with D-Asp for 15 days before EDS-injection showed that all the considered parameters were quite normal. To explore the probable mechanism(s) involved in the protection exerted by D-Asp, we considered the increased oxidative stress induced by EDS and the D-Asp antioxidant effects. Thiobarbiturc acid-reactive species (TBARS) levels increased following EDS-injection, while no change was observed in the D-Asp + EDS treated rats. Our results showed that D-Asp may be used as a strategy to mitigate the toxic effects exerted by environmental pollutants, as endocrine disrupters, in order to preserve the reproductive function.",,"EDCs,Embryo,Human IVF,Oocyte","Embryonic Development,Endocrine Disruptors,Fertilization in Vitro,Humans,Infertility,Oocytes"

We have previously demonstrated that adult exposure to TBT altered the expression of neuropeptides in the hypothalamus. In this study, we orally administered daily a solution containing oil, or TBT (0.25, 2.5, or 25‚ÄâŒºg/kg body weight/day) to pregnant females from gestational day 8 until birth, and to their pups from day 0 until post-natal day 21. Our results showed that TBT exposure of female mice during gestation and of pups during lactation permanently altered the feeding efficiency of pups of both sexes and subcutaneous fat distribution in adult males. In addition, the neuropeptide Y system was affected at the level of the paraventricular nucleus, with a decrease in immunoreactivity in both sexes (significant in females for all TBT doses and in males only for intermediate TBT doses), while no effect was observed in other hypothalamic areas (arcuate, ventromedial and dorsomedial nuclei). Metabolic syndrome, as well as obesity and diabetes, which are significant health issues, are considered multifactorial diseases and may be caused by exposure to metabolic disruptors, both in adults and during perinatal life. In addition, our work indicates that TBT doses defined as the tolerably daily intake had a profound and sex-specific long-term effect.",,"Docking,Endocrine disruptors,Epidemiological evidence,Nuclear hormone receptors,per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances","Endocrine Disruptors,Endocrine System,Fluorocarbons,Humans,Ligands,Molecular Docking Simulation"

Previous experiments have shown behavioral deficits caused by EDCs that have implications for social competence and sexual selection. The neuromolecular mechanisms for these behavioral changes induced by EDCs have not been thoroughly explored. Here, we tested the hypothesis that EDCs administered to rats during a critical period of embryonic brain development would lead to the disruption of normal social preference behavior, and that this involves a network of underlying gene pathways in brain regions that regulate these behaviors. Rats were exposed prenatally to human-relevant concentrations of EDCs (polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs], vinclozolin [VIN]), or vehicle. In adulthood, a sociosexual preference test was administered. We profiled gene expression of in preoptic area, medial amygdala, and ventromedial nucleus. Prenatal PCBs impaired sociosexual preference in both sexes, and VIN disrupted this behavior in males. Each brain region had unique sets of genes altered in a sex- and EDC-specific manner. The effects of EDCs on individual traits were typically small, but robust; EDC exposure changed the relationships between gene expression and behavior, a pattern we refer to as dis-integration and reconstitution. These findings underscore the effects that developmental exposure to EDCs can have on adult social behavior, highlight sex-specific and individual variation in responses, and provide a foundation for further work on the disruption of genes and behavior after prenatal exposure to EDCs.",,"endocrine disruptors,environmental exposure,epigenetics,gene expression,lipids,methylation,mitochondria,oxidative stress,redox signaling,translational","Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Exposure,Environmental Health,Epigenesis, Genetic,Epigenomics,Humans,Mitochondria"

In the present study, the role of BPA, an ""endocrine disruptor"" with respect to adiposopathy was evaluated in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. For the study, 150 healthy control subjects and 150 newly diagnosed diabetes patients were recruited. Fasting venous blood samples was analyzed for several biochemical parameters such as serum glucose, lipid profile, insulin, adiponectin, leptin, TNF-Œ±, IL-6, IL-1, free fatty acid. Concentrations of BPA were also measured both in control and diabetic subjects. Serum BPA concentration was found to be significantly higher in diabetic subjects in comparison to the control subjects. Levels of BPA were found to be positively correlated with BMI and WC in diabetic subjects. Also, it was found to be positively correlated with leptin and negatively correlated with adiponectin in diabetic subjects. Therefore, the current study suggested more deleterious effect of BPA on diabetes and its pathophysiology.",,,"Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Exposure,Environmental Pollutants,Health Policy,Humans"

Many environmental chemicals can inhibit the androgen signaling pathway, which raises the question if developmental exposure to anti-androgenic chemicals can negatively impact female fertility. Here, we report on altered reproductive hormone profiles in prepubertal female rats following developmental exposure to three pesticides with anti-androgenic potential: linuron (25 and 50¬†mg/kg bw/d), dimethomorph (60 and 180¬†mg/kg bw/d) and imazalil (8 and 24¬†mg/kg bw/d). Dams were orally exposed from gestational day 7 (dimethomorph and imazalil) or 13 (linuron) until birth, then until end of dosing at early postnatal life. Linuron and dimethomorph induced dose-related reductions to plasma corticosterone levels, whereas imazalil mainly suppressed gonadotropin levels. In the ovaries, expression levels of target genes were affected by linuron and dimethomorph, suggesting impaired follicle growth. Based on our results, we propose that anti-androgenic chemicals can negatively impact female reproductive development. This highlights a need to integrate data from all levels of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, as well as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, when investigating the potential impact of endocrine disruptors on female reproductive development and function.",,"Effects-directed analysis,Endocrine-active chemicals,Framework,Sampling,Water","Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Monitoring,Limit of Detection,Probability,Water Pollutants, Chemical"

35669359,-85,,,Exposure to Low Doses of Oxybenzone During Perinatal Development Alters Mammary Gland Stroma in Female Mice.,"Mammary stroma is a prominent modulator of epithelial development, and a complex set of interactions between these tissue compartments is essential for normal development, which can be either permissive or restrictive in tumor initiation and progression. During perinatal development, exposures of mice to oxybenzone, a common UV filter, environmental pollutant and endocrine disruptor, induce alterations in mammary epithelium. Our prior research indicates that oxybenzone alters mammary epithelial structures at puberty and in adulthood. We had also previously observed changes in the expression of hormone receptors at puberty (e.g., oxybenzone induced a decrease in the number of epithelial cells positive for progesterone receptor) and in adulthood (e.g., oxybenzone induced a decrease in the number of estrogen receptor-positive epithelial cells), and increased body weight in adulthood. Here, we investigated mammary stromal changes in BALB/c animals exposed during gestation and perinatal development to 0, 30, or 3000¬†Œºg oxybenzone/kg/day. In mice exposed to 30¬†Œºg/kg/day, we observed morphological changes in adulthood (e.g., a thicker periductal stroma and adipocytes that were considerably larger). We also observed an increased number of mast cells in the mammary stroma at puberty which may represent a transient influence of oxybenzone exposure. These results provide additional evidence that even low doses of oxybenzone can disrupt hormone sensitive outcomes in the mammary gland when exposures occur during critical windows of development, and some of these effects manifest in later life.",,"Meta-analysis,Miscarriage,Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances,Preterm birth,Stillbirth","Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Pollutants,Female,Fluorocarbons,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Maternal Exposure,Pregnancy,Premature Birth"

In the present study, we investigate the functional role of astaxanthin during autophagic cell death induced by the estrogenic endocrine-disrupting chemical bisphenol A (BPA) in normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF). BPA significantly induced apoptotic cell death and autophagy in NHDF. Autophagic cell death evoked by BPA was significantly restored upon a treatment with astaxanthin (10 ŒºM) via the inhibition of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Astaxanthin inhibited the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) stimulated by ROS production, but it did not influence the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in BPA-treated NHDF. Astaxanthin abrogated the ERK-mediated activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-Œ∫B), which is responsible for the mRNA expression of LC3-II, Beclin-1, Atg12, and Atg14 during apoptotic cell death induced by BPA.

The Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1)-nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway acts an important role in preventing oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of oxidative stress caused by NP on Keap1-Nrf2 pathway in rats. Rats were treated with NP (30, 90, 270¬†mg/kg) for different exposure time (7, 14 and 28 days). The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in serum and glutathione S-transferase (GST), UDP-Glucuronosyl Transferase (UGT) in liver were detected by ELISA kits. Western blot was used to detect Keap1, Nrf2 protein expression in liver and cerebral cortex. The results showed that 28 days of NP exposure significantly increased ROS levels in NPH group. And 14 days exposure to NP significantly enhanced the levels of GST and UGT, while 28 days of exposure showed a suppressive effect. In liver, Keap1 levels was upregulated at 7, 14 and 28 days of NP exposure, while nuclear Nrf2 levels decreased at 7 and 28 days but increased at 14 days. In cerebral cortex, Keap1 and Nrf2 expression increased at 14 days but decreased at 28 days. Besides, with the prolongation of NP exposure time, the GST and UGT levels in NPM and NPH groups were increased firstly and then decreased, while Keap1 and Nrf2 protein levels were constantly decreased in liver and cerebral cortex. In conclusion, the lower dose and shorter exposure time of NP activated the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway that may reduce the damage of oxidative stress, but when further exposed to NP at higher dose and time, the pathway could be inhibited.",,"EDCs detoxification,Genistein,Intestinal toxicity,ROS-responsive nanomaterial","Endocrine Disruptors,Estrogen Receptor beta,Genistein,Nanostructures,Reactive Oxygen Species"

Mancozeb (1 and 3¬†Œºg/ml) significantly reduced Jeg-3 trophoblastic spheroids attachment to endometrial epithelial Ishikawa cells. Mancozeb treatment from gestation day (GD) 1 to GD8 or from GD4 to GD8 significantly lowered the number of implantation sites with higher incidence of morphological abnormalities in the reproductive tissues. However, these were not seen in the treatment from GD1 to GD4. Mancozeb at 30¬†mg/kg BW/d did not alter the expression of p53, COX-2, or PGFS transcripts in the uterus, but down-regulated the PGES transcript and protein. Mancozeb treatment in human endometrial stromal cells did not alter the decidualization response, but the morphological transformation was impaired. Taken together, exposure to Mancozeb affected embryo implantation probably through the modulation of decidualization and to delineate the exact mode of action needs further investigations.","Fungicides, Industrial,Maneb,mancozeb,Zineb","Bisphenol,Genistein,Phthalate,Phytoestrogen,Steroid","Endocrine Disruptors,Estrogen Receptor beta,Humans,Male,Prostate,Prostatic Neoplasms,Receptors, Estrogen"

Because PCP binds to PCP as well as sigma receptors, it is not known which receptor type mediates the various effects of the drug. The purpose of the present study was to characterize the effects of the acute administration of enantiomers of MK-801, a compound with a high degree of selectivity for PCP over sigma receptors, on the release of ACTH, corticosterone and prolactin in the rat. In addition, MK-801 was administered daily for eight days in order to test whether tolerance develops to MK-801-induced ACTH and corticosterone release after repeated administration. While both enantiomers of MK-801 markedly increased plasma levels of ACTH and corticosterone, the (+) enantiomer was more potent. Tolerance developed to MK-801-induced increases in ACTH and corticosterone after repeated administration. Plasma prolactin levels were not affected by either the acute or the repeated administration of MK-801. These results suggest that the decrease in plasma levels of prolactin produced by PCP-like drugs is not mediated by PCP receptors, and may be a marker for a sigma receptor-mediated effect.","Anticonvulsants,Dibenzocycloheptenes,Dizocilpine Maleate,Adrenocorticotropic Hormone,Prolactin,Corticosterone","Androgens,Endocrine disruptors,Endogenous hormones,Estrogens,Human milk,In vitro","Endocrine Disruptors,Estrogens,Gonadal Steroid Hormones,Humans,Milk, Human,Receptors, Androgen,Tandem Mass Spectrometry,Water Pollutants, Chemical"
32702374,-85,,,Butylparaben multigenerational reproductive assessment by continuous breeding in Hsd:Sprague Dawley SD rats following dietary exposure.,"Butylparaben (BP) is an antimicrobial agent utilized for decades as a preservative in numerous consumer products. The safety of parabens has recently come under scrutiny based on reports of estrogenic activity and suggested adverse effects upon the reproductive system. Due to the limited availability of studies that address the potential for BP exposure to induce reproductive toxicity, and clear evidence of human exposure, the National Toxicology Program conducted a multigenerational continuous breeding study to evaluate the impact of dietary BP-exposure at 0, 5000, 15,000, or 40,000‚ÄØppm on reproductive and developmental parameters in Hsd:Sprague Dawley SD rats. BP-exposure was not associated with adverse alterations of fertility, fecundity, pubertal attainment, or reproductive parameters in F0, F1, or F2 generations. Exposure-dependent increases in liver weights, and incidences of non-neoplastic liver lesions suggest the liver is a target organ of BP toxicity. No findings were observed that would support the purported mechanism of BP-induced endocrine disruption in perinatally-exposed rodents.","Anti-Infective Agents,Parabens,butylparaben","BPA,anxiety,endocrine disruptors,memory,phthalate,social behavior","Endocrine Disruptors,Female,Humans,Male,Pregnancy"

Recent studies suggest that rosuvastatin may act as an endocrine disruptor that potentially damages the hormonal axis and, consequently reproductive development and function of male rats. However, the effects of rosuvastatin exposure on rat female reproductive parameters remain unknown. In this study female rats were exposed to rosuvastatin at the doses of 0 (control), 3, or 10\xa0mg/Kg.bw/day from pre-puberty to adulthood. No alterations in the female reproductive parameters were observed at a dose of 3\xa0mg/Kg.bw. However, females exposed to 10\xa0mg/Kg.bw exhibited shorter estrous cycles, altered copulatory behavior, decreased serum prolactin level, and alterations in the liver, pituitary and placental weights, parameters to some extent influenced by the reproductive hormonal axis signaling pathway. On the other hand, pubertal onset, reproductive hormone levels, fertility, and histological parameters of the ovary, uterus, and placenta were unaltered by exposure to both doses of this statin. Thus, rosuvastatin exposure, at the higher dose, altered the reproductive function of female rats, probably due to the pleiotropic effects of this statin.

In this study, we used an established mouse model to study the effect of perinatal DEHP exposure on the DNA methylation profile in liver (a primary target tissue of DEHP) and blood (a common surrogate tissue) of both juvenile and adult mice. Despite exposure ceasing at 3‚Äâweeks of age (PND21), we identified thousands of sex-specific differential DNA methylation events in 5-month old mice, more than identified at PND21, both in blood and liver. Only a small number of these differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs) overlapped between the time points, or between tissues (i.e. liver and blood), indicating blood may not be an appropriate surrogate tissue to estimate the effects of DEHP exposure on liver DNA methylation. We detected sex-specific DMCs common between 3-week and 5-month samples, pointing to specific DNA methylation alterations that are consistent between weanling and adult mice. In summary, this is the first study to assess the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in liver and blood at two different aged cohorts in response to perinatal DEHP exposure. Our findings cast light on the implications of using surrogate tissue instead of target tissue in human population-based studies and identify epigenetic biomarkers for DEHP exposure.",,"bromophenols (BPs),endocrine hormones,in vitro-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE),inhibition,sulfotransferase (SULT)","Environmental Pollutants,Hormones,Humans,Protein Isoforms,Sulfotransferases"
21153290,-84,,,Effect of colchicine and taxol on thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor coupling to G protein in GH(3) cells.,"The role of membrane-associated tubulin in TRH receptor-G protein coupling was investigated with the use of compounds that influence tubulin function. TRH-stimulated G protein GTPase activity in GH(3) cell membranes was used to determine receptor-G protein coupling. TRH-stimulated GTPase activity was abolished by G(q) antibody, suggesting that TRH receptor coupling to G(q) results in the activation of G(q) and the subsequent hydrolysis of GTP. TRH (1 M) stimulated the enzymatic activity by up to 69 pmol/min/mg protein, and in the presence of 1 M colchicine the hormone-stimulated activity was only 26 pmol/min/mg protein. Similar inhibition of TRH receptor-G protein coupling was observed with tubulin antibodies and purified tubulin, suggesting that perturbation of membrane-associated tubulin and/or tubulin-G protein interaction by these compounds disrupts receptor-G protein interaction. Next, the events occurring at the initial stages of TRH-mediated signal transduction were correlated to prolactin (PRL) secretion in GH(3) cells. Colchicine (1 M) and taxol (1 M) inhibited the basal PRL secretion by 38 and 44%, respectively. In addition, colchicine (1 M) and taxol (1 M) significantly inhibited TRH-stimulated PRL secretion. TRH-stimulated PRL secretion in control, colchicine-, and taxol-treated cells was 13.9, 9.1, and 6 ng/mL, respectively. Furthermore, polymerized tubulin levels were decreased by colchicine and increased by taxol. These results suggest that perturbation of the steady state of tubulin-G(q) interaction may disrupt the initial events in TRH-mediated signal transduction.",,"3D printed adapter,Biosensors,Esterase-2,Fluorescence/luminescence,Membrane support,Pesticides/endocrine disruptors","Enzymes, Immobilized,Esterases,Fluorescence,Organophosphorus Compounds,Pesticides,Printing, Three-Dimensional"
32905190,-84,,,A moderate physiological dose of benzyl butyl phthalate exacerbates the high fat diet-induced diabesity in male mice.,"Exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) used in plastic manufacturing processes may be contributing to the current increase in metabolic disorders. Here, we determined that benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP), a common EDC and food packaging plasticizer, mixed into chow diet (CD) and high fat diets (HFD) at varying concentrations (4¬†Œºg/kg body weight (bw)/day, 169¬†Œºg/kg bw/day, 3¬†mg/kg bw/day, 50¬†mg/kg bw/day) produced a number of detrimental and sex-specific metabolic effects in C57BL/6 male and female mice after 16¬†weeks. Male mice exposed to moderate (3¬†mg/kg bw/day) concentrations of BBP in an HFD were especially affected, with significant increases in body weight due to significant increases in weight of liver and adipose tissue. Other doses did not show any significant changes when compared to only CD or HFD alone. HFD in the presence of 3¬†mg/kg bw/day BBP showed significant increases in fasting blood glucose, glucose intolerance, and insulin intolerance when compared to HFD alone. Furthermore, this group significantly alters transcriptional regulators involved in hepatic lipid synthesis and its downstream pathway. Interestingly, most of the BBP doses had no phenotypic effect when mixed with CD and compared to CD alone. The female mice did not show a similar response as the male population even though they consumed a similar amount of food. Overall, these data establish a dose which can be used for a BBP-induced metabolic research model and suggest that a moderate dosage level of EDC exposure can contribute to widely ranging metabolic effects.",,"Endocrine-disrupting chemicals,Fine particulate matter,Magnetic covalent organic frameworks,Magnetic solid-phase extraction,Phthalate esters","Esters,Humans,Limit of Detection,Magnetic Phenomena,Metal-Organic Frameworks,Particulate Matter,Phthalic Acids,Solid Phase Extraction,Tandem Mass Spectrometry"
35914601,-84,,,Gestational exposure to bisphenol analogues and kisspeptin levels in pregnant women and their children: A pregnancy-birth cohort study.,"Gestational exposure to bisphenol analogues (BPs)Ôºåespecially bisphenol A (BPA), has been associated with adverse pregnancy-related outcomes and altered reproductive development of offspring, but the underlying mechanisms are not well documented. Kisspeptin, a key regulator of reproductive health, could be the potential target for endocrine disrupting compounds like BPs. Among 528 mother-child pairs, we investigated the associations of gestational BPs exposure with kisspeptin levels in two critical life stages, pregnancy and pre-puberty. Maternal BPs and kisspeptin concentrations were measured in urine samples collected in the third trimester. Children's urine samples were collected at 6-year visit and analyzed for kisspeptin levels. Associations were observed between BPA and its alternatives and lower kisspeptin in pregnant women but higher kisspeptin in their children. In contrast, TCBPA was suggestively associated with higher kisspeptin in pregnant women but lower kisspeptin in children. Our study provides the first epidemiologic evidence that gestational exposure to selected BPs may be associated with altered kisspeptin system in both pregnant women and their children, sheds some light on the potential mechanisms underlying the various reproductive health outcomes following gestational BPA exposure, and suggests potential reproductive toxicities of other BPs in humans.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Kisspeptins,Phenols,bisphenol A","Endocrine disruptors,Estrogen receptor,Neutrophils,Parabens,Serine proteases,Xenoestrogens","Estrogen Receptor alpha,Estrogen Receptor beta,Estrogens,Humans,Neutrophils,Parabens"

Nicotine administration in adult animals has adverse effects on the ovary and uterus; however, the effects of fetal exposure to nicotine on postnatal ovarian function have not been determined. The goal of this study was to assess the effect of fetal and neonatal exposure to nicotine on ovarian function and fertility of the offspring. Nulliparous female Wistar rats were given 1 mg.kg-1.d-1 nicotine bitartrate, subcutaneously for 14 d prior to mating, during pregnancy and throughout lactation until weaning. Measures of fertility, breeding success, and serum levels of ovarian steroid hormones in offspring were assessed at 4 and 6 mo of age. Fetal and neonatal exposure to nicotine significantly increased the time to pregnancy as the animals aged. Similarly, evidence of altered ovarian steroidogenesis including increased serum progesterone concentrations and a decreased estrogen:progesterone ratio was observed in 6-mo-old animals. We conclude that fetal and neonatal exposure to nicotine results in delayed ovarian dysfunction in adult female offspring.","Gonadal Steroid Hormones,Nicotine,Cotinine","Endocrine disruption,Environmental contamination,Estrogen receptor,MVLN assay,Molecular docking and dynamics simulation","Estrogens,Estrone,Triazoles,Ultraviolet Rays"

Due to its widespread use, TCS and its derivatives have been detected in several environmental compartments, with potential bioaccumulation and persistence. Indeed, some studies have demonstrated that TCS may act as a potential endocrine disruptor for the reproductive system. In the current study, we are reporting on the results obtained for male rats after a two-generation reproduction toxicity study conducted with TCS. Female and male Wistar rats were treated daily by gavage with TCS at doses of 0.8, 2.4, and 8.0 mg/kg/day or corn oil (control group) over 10 weeks (F0) and over 14 weeks (F1) before mating and then throughout mating, until weaning F2 generations, respectively. TCS exposure decreased sperm viability and motility of F1 rats at the dose of 2.4 mg/kg. The effects of TCS on sperm quality may be related to the exposure window, which includes the programming of reproductive cells that occurs during fetal/neonatal development.","Anti-Infective Agents, Local,Endocrine Disruptors,Testosterone,Triclosan",,"Exercise,Growth Hormone,Homeostasis,Humans,Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Proteins,Prolactin,Thyroid Hormones"

This study reports on the occurrence and fate of six PAEs in raw and tap water samples collected from provincial waterworks located in Songkhla Province, Southern Thailand. In addition, the daily exposure and cumulative health risk of susceptible populations due to drinking tap water were evaluated by using four different reference dose (RfDs) sources. The maximum concentrations of PAEs in raw water were between 1.68 and 4.84 and 0.52 and 1.24 ¬µg/L in tap water. Moreover, the levels of PAEs in the tap water samples indicated the poor PAEs removal efficiency of the conventional treatment process (59.9-69.1%). The contribution of water to the daily intake of PAEs did not exceed 0.37% in all the groups. Furthermore, both the individual and cumulative risk assessment showed negligible noncarcinogenic and antiandrogenic risk for all the groups. Nevertheless, the cumulative risk showed an increasing trend in the order of infants > lactating mothers > pregnant women > nonpregnant women, suggesting that infants are more vulnerable. In additional, the newly proposed RfDAA yielded higher hazard quotient and hazard index estimates, which indicates it is a more sensitive tool than other RfDs for the assessment of the individual and mixture risk of pollutants. The carcinogenic risk of DEHP was acceptable in every group. However, we recommend a future cumulative risk assessment of vulnerable groups considering their simultaneous exposure to all chemicals that have antiandrogenic effects via tap water.","Drinking Water,Esters,Phthalic Acids,Dibutyl Phthalate,phthalic acid","Musculoskeletal disorders,age,fatigue failure,obesity healing,psychological stress,sex","Fatigue,Humans,Musculoskeletal Diseases,Occupational Diseases,Risk Factors,Stress, Psychological"
23041310,-83,,,Non-monotonic dose effects of in utero exposure to di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) on testicular and serum testosterone and anogenital distance in male mouse fetuses.,"Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant. Epidemiological studies suggest that DEHP decreases masculinization of male fetuses. Numerous rat studies report DEHP reduces fetal testosterone production at doses greatly exceeding human exposure. We fed pregnant CD-1 mice 0.5-500,000 g/kg/day DEHP from gestation day (GD) 9-18 and examined mothers and male fetuses on GD 18. We assessed non-monotonic dose-response by adding a quadratic term to a simple linear regression model. Except at the 500,000 g/kg/day dose, DEHP stimulated an increase in maternal and fetal serum testosterone and increased anogenital distance (AGD). Non-monotonic dose-response curves were noted for AGD and maternal, and testis testosterone (P values 0.013-0.021). Because data from our highest dose (500,000 g/kg/day) did not differ significantly from controls, this dose could have been incorrectly assumed to be the NOAEL had we only tested very high doses, as is typical in studies for regulatory agencies.","Endocrine Disruptors,Plasticizers,Testosterone,Diethylhexyl Phthalate","BPA,BPF,BPS,apoptosis,endocrine disrupting compound,fertility,oocyte competence","Female,Cattle,Animals,Benzhydryl Compounds,Apoptosis,Granulosa Cells"

The implant was made in one testis only. In animals with a 10.0-mg implant, the germinal epithelium showed degenerative changes following the 7-week period, but spermatogonia and spermatocytes were unaffected. The effect of gossypol acetate appeared to be at the spermatid level. The electron microscopic study showed that the acrosomal membranes were disrupted. Blood testosterone and LH, but not FSH, decreased significantly (P less than 0.01). The fertility studies showed 100% infertility but no loss in libido in the 10-mg implant group. Up to the 7-week period, implants of less than 10 mg produced no significant effects on any of the parameters mentioned above. Animals with 20-mg implants had toxic symptoms. From the results in this study, it is concluded that 10.0 mg of gossypol acetate implanted in a single pellet in one testis causes antispermatogenic effects.","Contraceptive Agents, Male,Drug Implants,Gonadal Steroid Hormones,Gossypol,gossypol acetic acid",,"Female,Fertility,Follicle Stimulating Hormone,Glucocorticoids,Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone,Humans,Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System,Male,Ovary,Pituitary-Adrenal System,Pregnancy,Stress, Physiological,Stress, Psychological,Testis"
35237412,-83,,,Hexaconazole exposure ravages biosynthesis pathway of steroid hormones: revealed by molecular dynamics and interaction.,"Widespread application of hexaconazole for agriculture purpose poses a threat to human health by disrupting normal endocrine homeostasis. To avoid adverse health effects on human, it is crucial to identify the effects of hexaconazole on key enzymes responsible for steroidal hormone synthesis. In view of this, present study was conducted to investigate the interaction mechanisms of hexaconazole with key enzymes in comparison with their food drug administration (FDA) approved inhibitor by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Results indicate that hexaconazole contacts with the active site of the key enzymes required for steroidal hormonal synthesis. Results pertaining to root-mean-square deviation, root-mean-square calculation, radius of gyration, hydrogen bonding and solvent accessible surface area exhibited that the interaction pattern and stability of interaction of hexaconazole was similar to enzyme specific inhibitor. In addition, ligand and enzyme complex interaction energy of hexaconazole was almost similar to key enzyme and FDA-approved enzyme specific inhibitor complex. This study offers a molecular level of understanding of hexaconazole with different enzymes required for steroidal hormonal synthesis. Findings of the study clearly suggest that hexaconazole has efficacy to stably interact with various enzyme required to progress the pathway of hormonal synthesis. If incessant exposure of hexaconazole occurs during agricultural work it may lead to ravage hormonal synthesis or potent endocrine disruption.

This study included 313 women diagnosed with breast cancer and 313 controls in Wuhan, China, and measured 18 OCPs in serum and 3 oxidative stress biomarkers in urine. Multivariable adjusted regression models were used to evaluate the associations among OCPs, oxidative stress biomarkers, and breast cancer. The mediating effect of oxidative stress was assessed by mediation analysis. We observed that most OCPs were positively associated with risk of breast cancer (all FDR-P values\xa0<\xa00.05 or 0.10). Moreover, we found that p,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDD, dieldrin, heptachlor, and heptachlor epoxide were positively associated with 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal-mercapturic acid (HNE-MA) and 8-iso-prostaglandin F (8-isoPGF), which in turn were positively associated with risk of breast cancer. Mediation analysis indicated that HNE-MA and 8-isoPGF mediated the positive associations between these OCPs and risk of breast cancer, with mediating proportion ranging from 6.23% to 19.9%.

The potential of endocrine disrupting chemicals to act as agonists or antagonists in critical hormonally regulated processes, such as mammary gland development and mammary tumorigenesis, demands evaluation of its potential in promoting breast cancer. This study identifies the effects of BP-3 on mammary tumorigenesis with high-fat diet during puberty versus adulthood in - transplant BALB/c mice. Benzophenone-3 exposure yielded levels in urine similar to humans subjected to heavy topical sunscreen exposure. Benzophenone-3 was protective for epithelial tumorigenesis in mice fed lifelong low-fat diet, while promotional for epithelial tumorigenesis in mice fed adult high-fat diet. Benzophenone-3 increased tumor cell proliferation, decreased tumor cell apoptosis, and increased tumor vascularity dependent on specific dietary regimen and tumor histopathology. Even in instances of an ostensibly protective effect, other parameters suggest greater risk. Although benzophenone-3 seemed protective on low-fat diet, spindle cell tumors arising in these mice showed increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. This points to a need for further studies of benzophenone-3 in both animal models and humans as a potential breast cancer risk factor, as well as a more general need to evaluate endocrine disrupting chemicals in varying dietary contexts.'}",,"Attention,Cognition,Continuous glucose monitoring,Disordered Eating,Eating Behaviors,Glycemic Variability,Impulsivity,Self-management,Type 1 Diabetes","Female,Humans,Male,Blood Glucose,Blood Glucose Self-Monitoring,Cognitive Dysfunction,Cross-Sectional Studies,Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1,Feeding and Eating Disorders,Self-Management"

In the present study, we have investigated cell death in the AtT20 pituitary cell line after exposure to coplanar PCB 126 and non-coplanar PCB 153. In addition, co-exposure to the PCBs and another neurotoxic food contaminant, methylmercury (MeHg), was studied to test possible interactive effects. Our results show that mainly necrosis is induced after exposure to the selected toxicants. Simultaneous exposure to moderately toxic doses of PCBs and MeHg resulted in additive or slightly synergistic effects on the induction of cell death. Furthermore, our data suggest that both PCB congeners trigger cell death in AtT20 cells via activation of calcium regulated calpains and lysosomal cathepsins, possibly through disruption of mitochondrial function and intracellular calcium signaling. However, caspase-activity appears not to be critical for PCB induced cell death in these cells. Presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and protective effects of pre-treatment with antioxidants were only found after MeHg exposure, suggesting that oxidative stress plays a major role in MeHg but not PCB toxicity in this experimental model.","Methylmercury Compounds,Reactive Oxygen Species,Polychlorinated Biphenyls,Caspases,3,4,5,3',4'-pentachlorobiphenyl,2,4,5,2',4',5'-hexachlorobiphenyl","Phthalates,birth weight,endocrine disruptors,fetal growth restriction,small for gestational age","Female,Pregnancy,Humans,Placenta,Phthalic Acids,Fetal Development,Endocrine Disruptors"

The effects of TCS exposure on individual social behaviors and the potential underlying mechanisms are still unknown. This study investigated the behavioral effects of 42-day exposure to TCS (0, 50, 100¬†mg/kg) in drinking water using the open field test (OFT), social dominance test (SDT), social interaction test (SIT), and novel object recognition task (NOR). Using 16S rRNA sequencing analysis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we observed the effects of TCS exposure on the gut microbiota and ultrastructure of hippocampal neurons and synapses. Behavioral results showed that chronic TCS exposure reduced the social dominance of male and female mice. TCS exposure also reduced social interaction in male mice and impaired memory formation in female mice. Analysis of the gut microbiota showed that TCS exposure increased the relative abundance of the Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria phyla in female mice. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that TCS exposure induced ultrastructural damage to hippocampal neurons and synapses. These findings suggest that TCS exposure may affect social behaviors, which may be caused by altered gut microbiota and impaired plasticity of hippocampal neurons and synapses.","RNA, Ribosomal, 16S,Triclosan","Food contact materials,bisphenol F,coating composition,migration testing,phenols,resole","Food Contamination,Food Packaging,Phenols,Polyesters,Resins, Synthetic"
36379430,-82,,,Glyphosate mimics 17Œ≤-estradiol effects promoting estrogen receptor alpha activity in breast cancer cells.,"Glyphosate, the active ingredient in several broad-spectrum herbicide formulations, has been validated and widely used throughout the world. Recent reports have questioned its safety, showing that glyphosate may act as an endocrine disruptor by promoting estrogenic activity. However, the molecular mechanism involved in this phenomenon remains unclear. Therefore, here we aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which glyphosate induces estrogenic activity using estrogen-sensitive breast cancer cell line models. Our results show that glyphosate mimics the cell effects of 17Œ≤-estradiol (E2), promoting estrogen receptor Œ± (ERŒ±) phosphorylation, its degradation, and transcriptional activity at high concentrations. The molecular mechanism seems involved in the ERŒ± ligand-binding domain (LBD). Molecular simulations suggest a plausible interaction between glyphosate and the LBD through a coordinated complex involving divalent cations such as Zn (II). In addition, glyphosate exposure alters the level of Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 that contribute to ERŒ± phosphorylation. Finally, glyphosate increases cell proliferation rate and levels of cell cycle regulators, accompanied by an increase in anchorage-independent growth capacity. These findings suggest that glyphosate at high concentrations, induces estrogen-like effects through an ERŒ± ligand binding site-dependent mechanism, leading to cellular responses resulting from a complex interplay of genomic and non-genomic events.",,"Dibutyltin maleate,Food contact materials,Migration test,Organotin compounds,Surface-enhanced Raman scattering,Tributyltin","Food Packaging,Metal Nanoparticles,Organotin Compounds,Silver,Spectrum Analysis, Raman"

Gestational BPA exposure increased vasopressin neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the region that regulates circadian rhythms, of F1 and F3 generations. Mechanistically, BPA increased proliferation of hypothalamic neural progenitors ex vivo and caused precocious neurogenesis in vivo. Co-antagonism of both estrogen and androgen receptors was necessary to block BPA's effects on hypothalamic neural progenitors, illustrating a dual role for these endocrine targets.

Some epidemiologic studies have reported that the endocrine disrupting polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in serum may be associated with TGCT risk, but the evidence is inconsistent. Our goal was to investigate whether serum levels of PCBs are associated with the increase of TGCT risk. We conducted a population-based case-control study of 308 TGCT cases and 323 controls, all residents of Connecticut and Massachusetts. Serum levels of 56 PCBs congeners were measured using gas chromatography and unconditional logistic regression model was used to evaluate the risk of TGCT associated with total PCBs exposure, groups of PCBs categorized by Wolff's functional groups, and individual PCB congeners. The results showed that there was no association between total serum levels of PCBs and risk of TGCT overall (quartile 4 (Q4) vs. quartile 1 (Q1) odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (C.I.)¬†=¬†1.0 (0.6-1.9), œÅ trend¬†=¬†0.9).

We previously demonstrated that chronic exposure to CPF induces hormonal imbalance in vivo. The aim of this work was to study the effects of low concentrations of CPF (0.01 and 1¬†mg/kg/day) on the reproductive system of virgin adult rats. In the ovary, we studied the effects of CPF on steroidogenesis by determining steroid hormone content by RIA and CYP11 and CYP19 enzyme expression by qRT-PCR. The estrous cycle was evaluated by microscopic observation of vaginal smear, as well as by changes in uterine histology. In endometrium, we determined the fractal dimension and expression of PCNA, ERŒ± and PR by IHC. Our results showed that chronic exposure to CPF affects ovarian steroid synthesis, causing alterations in the normal cyclicity of animals. In addition, CPF induced proliferative changes in the uterus, suggesting that it could affect reproduction or act as a risk factor in the development of uterine proliferative pathologies.","Insecticides,Chlorpyrifos",,"Genes, Tumor Suppressor,Humans,Oncogenes,Thyroid Neoplasms"
36153926,-82,,,Bisphenol A induces testicular oxidative stress in mice leading to ferroptosis.,"Bisphenol A is a common environmental factor and endocrine disruptor that exerts a negative impact on male reproductive ability. By exploring bisphenol A-induced testicular cell death using the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mouse model, we found that a ferroptosis phenomenon may exist. Mice were divided into six groups and administered different doses of bisphenol A via intragastric gavage once daily for 45 consecutive days. Serum was then collected to determine the levels of superoxide dismutase and malondialdehyde. Epididymal sperm was also collected for semen analysis, and testicular tissue was collected for ferritin content determination, electron microscope observation of mitochondrial morphology, immunohistochemistry, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and western blot analysis. Exposure to bisphenol A was found to decrease sperm quality and cause oxidative damage, iron accumulation, and mitochondrial damage in the testes of mice. In addition, bisphenol A was confirmed to affect the expression of the ferroptosis-related genes, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), and acyl-CoA synthetase 4 (ACSL4) in mouse testicular tissues. Accordingly, we speculate that bisphenol A induces oxidative stress, which leads to the ferroptosis of testicular cells. Overall, the inhibition of ferroptosis may be a potential strategy to reduce male reproductive toxicity caused by bisphenol A.",,"Adaptogen,Homeostasis,Hormesis,Modulant of Homeostatic Signaling,TCM Tonics","Homeostasis,Hormesis,Humans,Oxidation-Reduction,Signal Transduction"

33932909,-81,,,Association of low-level environmental exposure to cadmium and lead with gout flare using a cohort study design.,"Cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) are toxic heavy metals with endocrine-disrupting properties. We investigated the associations of low-level environmental exposure to Cd/Pb and gout status (intercritical gout, gout flare and combined gout) in a cohort study. We measured by ICP-MS the levels of Cd and Pb in blood (Cd-B and Pb-B) and urine (Cd-U and Pb-U) from 408 participants with blood and 346 participants with urine samples recruited from a hospital gout clinic. The median levels of Cd-B and Pb-B (in Œºg/L) in the gout flare group were 0.87 (range 0.41-2.49) and 31.54 (25.38-41.46), respectively, and the median levels of Cd-U and Pb-U in the gout flare group were 1.05 (0.69-1.91) and 3.86 (3.49-4.44), respectively. These medians were significantly higher than those in the control or intercritical groups (P¬†<¬†0.05). For Cd-B in tertile 2 (T2) and Cd-U in tertile 3, Cd levels were significantly associated with gout flare status compared to the reference tertile 1 (OR¬†=¬†4.3, P¬†=¬†0.041 and OR¬†=¬†25.1, P¬†=¬†0.002, respectively) after adjustment under Model 3. For Pb-U, the risk of gout flare status was significantly higher in T2 (OR¬†=¬†51.0, P¬†=¬†0.002) compared to the T1 under Model 3. Our results show that median levels of Cd-B, Pb-B, Cd-U and Pb-U in the gout flare group were significantly higher than participants without gout or with gout but in the intercritical period. We provide evidence that the risk of gout flare status is associated with increased Cd levels, and that blood and urine levels of Cd are a risk factor for gout flare status.","Cadmium,Lead","Bisphenol A,ChIP-seq,RNA-seq,Uterine leiomyoma,XBP1","Humans,Female,Uterine Neoplasms,Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases,Leiomyoma,Benzhydryl Compounds,X-Box Binding Protein 1"
35430282,-81,,,Tributyltin inhibits development of pubertal Leydig cells in rats.,"Tributyltin (TBT) is extensively applied as an antifouling mediator, and it is well-known as an endocrine disrupting chemical. However, it remains elusive whether TBT can affect the development of pubertal Leydig cells (LCs), as a part of its endocrine mechanism of action. In this study, male Sprague Dawley rats (35-day-old) orally received TBT (0, 1, or 5‚ÄØmg/kg) for 24 days. Immature LCs (ILCs) were separated from 35-day-old rats, and the cells were exposed to TBT at various concentrations (0, 0.05, 0.5, 1, or 5‚ÄØŒºM) for 24‚ÄØh. In vivo TBT treatment decreased the number of LCs and inhibited androgen production (2.92‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ0.44, 1.16‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ0.29, and 0.67‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ0.10‚ÄØng/ml after treatment with TBT at 0, 1, and 5‚ÄØmg/kg, respectively). In vitro TBT treatment reduced androgen production, cell viability, and cell cycle progression, while increased the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) along with subsequent apoptosis, particularly at the concentration of 5‚ÄØŒºM. According to in vitro and in vivo findings, TBT downregulated the expression levels of genes that could control steroidogenesis (Hsd17b3, Scarb1, Hsd3b1, and Star), and decreased protein levels due to potential reduction of NR5A1 (Nr5a1). In summary, TBT inhibited cholesterol transport and activities of certain steroidogenic enzymes, thereby leading to the reduction of androgen production.","Androgens,Trialkyltin Compounds,tributyltin","Binding affinity,Binding mechanism,Hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers,Molecular dynamics simulation,Thyroid receptor Œ≤","Humans,Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers,Molecular Dynamics Simulation,Thyroid Gland,Thyroid Hormones,Protein Binding,Thyroid Hormone Receptors beta,Hydroxylation"
22154466,-81,,,Maternal exposure to 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol alters embryonic development of GnRH-1 neurons in mouse.,"To evaluate the potentially disrupting effects of environmental estrogens on neuroendocrine networks controlling reproduction, we studied the impact of the pharmaceutical product 17--ethinylestradiol (EE2) on gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH-1) neuron development in mouse embryo. Pregnant mice were treated per os with EE2 at 0.01, 0.1 or 1 g/kg/day, between embryonic days 10.5 (E10.5) and E13.5, a period during which GnRH-1 neurons are generated and start their intra-nasal migration. Embryos at E13.5 were examined and processed for GnRH-1 immunohistochemistry. Immunopositive neurons were counted all along their migratory path. A short oral administration of environmentally relevant doses of EE2 to pregnant mice had a significant impact on whole embryo development, leading to a limited but significant growth retardation. The total number of GnRH-1 neurons was statistically significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner. The repartition of GnRH-1 neurons along their migratory path was not affected by EE2 treatment. These results suggest an impact of environmental EE2 concentrations on embryonic GnRH-1 development through a modulation of neurogenesis and/or apoptosis.","Protein Precursors,progonadoliberin I,Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone,Ethinyl Estradiol","Environment,Meta-analysis,Metals,Systematic review,Thyroid cancer","Humans,Incidence,Metals, Heavy,Thyroid Neoplasms"

It was found that the main mechanisms of disruptive action of DDT leading to a decrease in epinephrine secretion into systemic circulation are a decrease in the growth rate of the adrenal medulla, a decrease in the number of mitochondria in adrenal cells, especially under the outer cytoplasmic membrane, destructive changes in mitochondria, and a progressive decrease in the synthesis of tyrosine hydroxylase. The decrease in the number of mitochondria and suppression tyrosine hydroxylase synthesis in adrenal cells predominate during the pubertal period, while slowdown of the growth of the adrenal medulla and progressive decrease in the synthesis of tyrosine hydroxylase seem to be the most evident mechanisms after puberty.","DDT,Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase,Epinephrine","Double charge transfer process,MIL-100(Fe)/ZnFe(2)o(4)/PCN,Nonylphenol,Photocatalytic,Visible light irradiation","Humans,Light,Lysergic Acid Diethylamide,Nitriles,Phenols,Photolysis,Porosity"

Our previous work in activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells demonstrated that exposure to ""low-dose"" BPA diminished telomerase activity via an ER/GPR30-ERK signalling pathway. Leukocyte telomerase activity and telomere maintenance are crucial for normal immune function and homeostasis. We thus here further studied the effects of BPA on human T cell subpopulations. Exposure to 0.3-3¬†nM BPA, i. e. at doses in the realm of human exposure, notably reduced telomerase activity in activated CD8‚Äâ+‚ÄâT but not CD4‚Äâ+‚ÄâT cells in a non-monotonic response pattern as determined by the TRAP-ELISA assay. Under long-term BPA exposure, significant telomere length shortening, reduction in mitochondrial DNA copy number, cell proliferation and IFN-Œ≥ as well as hTERT protein suppression could be observed in CD8‚Äâ+‚Äâlymphocytes, as analysed by qRT-PCR, flow cytometry and western blot analysis. This study extends our previous in vitro findings that ""low-dose"" BPA has potential negative effects on healthy human cytotoxic T cell response.

To investigate the relationship between exposure of alkylphenols in serum of pregnant women during early pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes, a total of 2035 healthy pregnant women and their neonates were recruited in the birth cohort of Zhuang nationality in Guangxi from 2015 to 2018. The peripheral venous blood samples were collected from pregnant women in early pregnancy; the concentrations of nonylphenol (NP), 4-nonylphenol (4-N-NP), 4-tert-octylphenol (4-T-OP), and 4-n-octylphenol (4-N-OP) in serum were detected by ultra-performance liquid\xa0performance chromatography-tandem\xa0mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS).

35893447,-80,,,The Role of Cholesterol in the Interaction of the Lipid Monolayer with the Endocrine Disruptor Bisphenol-A.,"Among pollutants of emerging concern, endocrine disruptors (ED) have been shown to cause side effects in humans and animals. Bisphenol-A (BPA) is an ED by-product of the plastic industry and one of the chemicals with the highest volume produced yearly. Here, we studied the role of cholesterol in the BPA exposure effects over membrane models. We used Langmuir films of both neat lipid DPPC (1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and cholesterol (Chol) and a binary mixture containing DPPC/Chol, exposing it to BPA. We evaluate changes in the œÄ-A isotherms and the PM-IRRAS (polarization modulation-infrared reflection adsorption spectroscopy) spectra. BPA exposure induced changes in the DPPC and Chol neat monolayers, causing mean molecular area expansion and altering profiles. However, at high surface pressure, the BPA was expelled from the air-water interface. For the DPPC/Chol mixture, BPA caused expansion throughout the whole compression, indicating that BPA is present at the monolayer interface. The PM-IRRAS analysis showed that BPA interacted with the phosphate group of DPPC through hydrogen bonding, which caused the area's expansion. Such evidence might be biologically relevant to better understand the mechanism of action of BPA in cell membranes once phosphatidylcholines and Chol are found in mammalian membranes.",,"Acidification,Aggregation,Bisphenol A,Mixture of nanoparticles,Seawater","Hydrogen-Ion Concentration,Nanoparticles,Plasticizers,Seawater,Water Pollutants, Chemical"

However, little is known about the long-term consequences of simultaneous exposure to BPA and a HFD on reproductive health. Herein, we assessed the effects of maternal exposure to BPA in combination with a HFD on reproductive function in subsequent generations of female mice and evaluated its effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. We found that the combination of maternal exposure to BPA and a HFD led to increased urine BPA levels, precocious puberty, altered estrous cyclicity, decreased follicle numbers, and altered hypothalamic Kiss1 methylation status in F1 and F2 mice. Therefore, we demonstrated that maternal exposure to BPA in combination with a HFD exerts a trans-generational effect on female reproduction.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Dietary Fats,Endocrine Disruptors,Phenols,bisphenol A","BLL,BMD,Endocrine effects,General population","Male,Humans,Female,Middle Aged,Thyroxine,Benchmarking,Lead,Thyrotropin,Insulin"

We retrospectively analyzed the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2004 and compared the baseline demographics in individuals according to the presence of NAFLD (fatty liver index [FLI]‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ60). Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine whether OCP concentration affected NAFLD prevalence and subgroup analyses regarding NAFLD-related variables and advanced hepatic fibrosis (FIB-4‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ2.67) were performed. Of the 1515 individuals, 579 (38.2%) had NAFLD. Oxychlordane showed concentration-dependent risk for NAFLD (OR 3.471 in fourth quartile [Q4]; 95% CI 1.865-6.458; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.007). p,p'-DDE and trans-nonachlor showed similar trends without statistical significance. Conversely, mirex showed the lowest risk for NAFLD in the highest concentration quartile (OR 0.29 in Q4; 95% CI 0.175-0.483; P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001). Oxychlordane showed the most pronounced association with the levels of each component of FLI and liver enzymes. None of the OCPs were significantly associated with advanced fibrosis. In conclusion, among OCPs, exposure to oxychlordane showed the most prominent impact associated with NAFLD.","Endocrine Disruptors,Pesticides,Dichlorodiphenyl Dichloroethylene","Neuroendocrine tumour,Pregnancy,VIPoma","Male,Pregnancy,Female,Humans,Adult,Vipoma,Pancreatic Neoplasms,Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide"
33740565,-80,,,Lifetime dietary exposure to bisphenol A in the general population and during pregnancy: Foetal exposure and health risk assessment.,"Bisphenol A is a well-known chemical substance triggering reprotoxic and endocrine disruptor effects. Pregnancy is considered as a critical period of exposure to BPA because of the foetal sensitivity to endocrine disruption. Because of its wide use in food packaging, BPA is found in common foods and in infant formulae. We used a lifetime approach to simulate dietary exposure trajectories of a French population and to assess the associated health risk. Moreover, a semi-physiological based toxicokinetic model was used to simulate the maternal-foetal exchanges of BPA during pregnancy. Metabolism was taken into account by considering the glucuronidation of BPA by the foetal-placental unit, as well as the reactivation of BPA-glucuronide into BPA in the foetal compartment. From maternal critical daily exposures defined by ANSES based on effects for different endpoints of BPA in the unborn child (i.e. 0.083, 0.17, 0.29 and 0.33¬†Œºg/kg¬†bw/d, respectively based on effects on mammary gland, brain and behaviour, metabolism and obesity and female reproductive system), resulting concentrations of BPA in the foetal compartment were estimated and health risk was assessed for the sub-population of unborn children. This work leads to the conclusion that while a health risk due to dietary exposures of the general population can be excluded, this is not the case for the sub-population of pregnant women, in view of the levels of foetal exposure to BPA.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Phenols,bisphenol A","Anovulation,Endocrine disruption,Estrogen signaling,Fluoxetine","Mice,Female,Animals,Fluoxetine,Estrous Cycle,Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors,Antidepressive Agents,Uterus,Estrogens"
33387635,-80,,,Adult female rats perinatally exposed to perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) and a mixture of endocrine disruptors display increased body/fat weights without a transcriptional footprint in fat cells.,"Obesity is a complex disease with many causes, including a possible role for environmental chemicals. Perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) is one of many per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) frequently detected in humans and it is suspected to be an obesogenic compound. We examined the potential long-term effects of PFHxS on metabolic parameters in rats after developmental exposure to 0.05, 5 or 25 mg/kg bw/day, with or without co-exposure to a background mixture of twelve endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDmix). Both male and female offspring showed signs of lower birth weight following intrauterine exposure. Female offspring exposed to both PFHxS and EDmix had increased body weight in adulthood. The retroperitoneal fat pad was larger in the PFHxS-exposed female offspring when compared to those exposed to EDmix alone. An attempt to detect putative molecular markers in the fat tissue by performing whole transcriptome profiling revealed no significant changes between groups and there were no significant effects on plasma leptin levels in exposed females. Our results show that early life exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals can influence body weight later in life, but the effect is not necessarily reflected in changed gene expression in the fat tissue.","Endocrine Disruptors,Fluorocarbons,Sulfonic Acids,perfluorohexanesulfonic acid","Chlorination,Disinfection byproducts,Microplastic polymers,Polyamide,UV aging","Microplastics,Halogenation,Chlorine,Plastics,Nylons,Disinfection,Polymers,Water,Polyesters,Water Pollutants, Chemical,Water Purification,Disinfectants"

Rat dams were provided a semipurified diet containing the isoflavonoid coumestrol at a concentration (0.01%) previously found to be uterotrophic. Coumestrol treatment did not significantly alter the time of vaginal opening, although vaginal opening did occur at a lighter body weight. By 132 days of age, 83% of coumestrol-treated females exhibited the cornified smears of a persistent estrous state. By contrast, 91% of control animals were cycling regularly at 132 days of age. Estradiol stimulation failed to elicit an LH elevation in the coumestrol-treated animals, suggesting the possibility of neuroendocrine impairments. These findings indicate that the female offspring of mothers fed a low-level phytoestrogen diet during lactation manifest early and nearly universal disruption of cyclicity of the persistent-estrus type.","Estrogens,Estrogens, Non-Steroidal,Isoflavones,Phytoestrogens,Plant Preparations,Luteinizing Hormone,Coumestrol","breast cancer,chromatin regulation,endocrine therapy,epigenetics,estrogen receptor - ESR1,transcription factor",

Due to the frequent use of soy milk in the neonatal diet, we aimed to study the effects of early GEN exposure on some physiological and reproductive parameters. Mice of both sexes from PND1 to PND8 were treated with GEN (50 mg/kg body weight, comparable to the exposure level in babies fed with soy-based formulas). When adult, we observed, in GEN-treated females, an advanced pubertal onset and an altered estrous cycle, and, in males, a decrease of testicle weight and fecal testosterone concentration. Furthermore, we observed an increase in body weight and altered plasma concentrations of metabolic hormones (leptin, ghrelin, triiodothyronine) limited to adult females. Exposure to GEN significantly altered kisspeptin and POMC immunoreactivity only in females and orexin immunoreactivity in both sexes. In conclusion, early postnatal exposure of mice to GEN determines long-term sex-specific organizational effects. It impairs the reproductive system and has an obesogenic effect only in females, which is probably due to the alterations of neuroendocrine circuits controlling metabolism; thus GEN, should be classified as a metabolism disrupting chemical.",,"analysis,dairy products,estrogenic disrupting compounds,pretreatment",

Here, we established a large dataset for the biomonitoring of seven representative congeners of PFAS by examining data from 2325 publications. Global exposure to perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) was the highest, followed by perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Spatiotemporal exposure to PFAS varied considerably, with daily intake estimated in the range of 0.01-1.7 ng/kg/day. Moreover, decreasing trends in PFOS, PFHxS, and PFOA exposure were noted in most regions of the world over the past two decades, but such trends were not observed for other PFAS with long carbon chains, especially in East Asia. Furthermore, we estimated that human exposure to PFOA contributed to approximately 461,635 (95% confidence interval: 57,418 to 854,645) cases per year of LBW during the past two decades, predominantly from Asian regions. Although our estimation may be constrained by uncertainties from the dose-response curve and data availability, this study has unveiled that PFAS might be a contributor to global LBW prevalence during 2000-2019, supporting continuous actions to mitigate PFAS contamination.","Alkanesulfonic Acids,Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Pollutants,Fluorocarbons,Carbon","Insufficient sleep,circadian misalignment,gut microbiome,metabolism",

35955476,-79,,,Multigenerational Exposure to Uranium Changes Sperm Metabolome in Rats.,"Male infertility is a major public health issue that can be induced by a host of lifestyle risk factors such as environment, nutrition, smoking, stress, and endocrine disruptors. Regarding the human population exposed to uranium, it is necessary to explore these effects on male reproduction in multigenerational studies. The sensitivity of mass spectrometry (MS)-based methods has already proved to be extremely useful in metabolite identification in rats exposed to low doses of uranium, but also in human sperm. We applied this method to rat sperm over three generations (F0, F1 and F2) with multigenerational uranium exposure. Our results show a significant content of uranium in generation F0, and a reduction in the pregnancy rate only in generation F1. Based on principal component analysis (PCA), we observed discriminant profiles between generations. The partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) of the 48 annotated variables confirmed that parental exposure of generation F0 (during both the preconceptional and prenatal periods) can have metabolic effects on spermatozoa for the next two generations. Metabolomics applied to epididymal spermatozoa is a novel approach to detecting the multigenerational effects of uranium in an experimental model, but could be also recommended to identify potential biomarkers evaluating the impact of uranium on sperm in exposed infertile men.","Endocrine Disruptors,Uranium","endocrine disruption,female reproductive system,ovarian toxicity,reproductive toxicity,xylene",
36423724,-79,,,Levels of persistent organic pollutants in breast milk samples representing Finnish and Danish boys with and without hypospadias.,"Hypospadias is a congenital malformation of penile urethra with unknown etiology in most cases. Persistent organic pollutant (POP) exposure may disrupt endocrine function during a critical window of development of male genitalia. In animal studies, POPs have been associated with male reproductive disorders, including hypospadias, but only few studies have assessed this relationship in humans. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between hypospadias and POP concentration levels in breast milk, as a proxy for prenatal exposure. This is a nested case-control study of Danish and Finnish mother-son pairs. Maternal breast milk samples were collected between 1997 and 2002, and they represent infant boys born with hypospadias [n¬†=¬†33 (n¬†=¬†22 Danish and n¬†=¬†11 Finnish)] and their 1:1 matched controls. Breast milk samples were analyzed for six classes of POPs [including dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls, flame retardants and perfluorinated alkylated substances (PFAS)]. We estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each chemical class using conditional logistic regression. In addition, a composite exposure score system was used to explore the effect of a POP mixture (four chemical classes): The composite score was categorized as low, moderate, or high exposure, and differences between cases and controls were tested with conditional logistic regression. No statistically significant associations were observed between the sums of the chemical classes and hypospadias in either country. The composite score was unable to detect differences in the risk of hypospadias between the tertiles of POP exposure. Levels of PFAS were significantly higher in Danish than in Finnish breast milk samples. This small study does not provide evidence for an association between hypospadias and exposure to POPs but adds information on quantitative exposures. Further development of multi-exposure models is needed for assessing the potential mixture effect associated with multiple chemical exposures.",,"Agitation,Estrone,Laccase activity,Spirulina CPCC-695,Temperature,pH",
32360183,-78,,,Associations of exposure to phthalates and environmental phenols with gynecological disorders.,"Phthalates and environmental phenols might be associated with some benign diseases that have been found to be hormone-sensitive. Current knowledge on adverse effects of these chemicals among reproductive women is limited and often controversial. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the association between the urinary concentration of phthalates and environmental phenols and gynecological disorders from 512 women of reproductive age. The association between chemical concentration and disease in the control and case groups was statistically determined with the questionnaire survey data and measurements using the LC-MS/MS. The results have shown that DEHP metabolites, ethyl paraben and 3,4-DHB showed significant direct associations with leiomyoma and benign ovarian tumors (p < 0.05). We found statistically significant positive relationships between exposure to chemicals (some DEHP metabolites, DHB) and prevalence of gynecologic disorders (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the ORs for leiomyoma associated with these compounds in always user for personal care products (PCPs) was higher than those of sometimes user. High levels of urinary concentrations of these compounds such as DEHP metabolites and parabens and their metabolites showed significant associations with leiomyoma and benign ovarian tumors.","Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Pollutants,Phenols,Phthalic Acids","Androgen,Circadian,Fertility,Sleep,Sleep Disordered Breathing",

However, up to 80% of women taking SSRI suffer from sexual dysfunction. We investigated the effects of fluoxetine (Prozac¬Æ) (low and high dose, n¬†=¬†6-7/group) on reproductive function and the regulation of the estrous cycle. All mice treated with high dose of fluoxetine had interruption of estrous cycles within a few days after onset of treatment. When treated for 14 days, mice in the high dose group had fewer CL, often lack of any CL, and antral follicles. Uterine expression of estrogen receptor alpha, G-protein coupled estrogen receptor, and steroidogenesis enzymes were upregulated in the high dose group. Nevertheless, decreased expression of connexin 43 and alkaline phosphatase and increased expression of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 and monoamine oxidase A are consistent with decreased estrogen signaling and the decreased uterine weight. Taken together, fluoxetine modulates estrogen synthesis/signaling and dysregulates estrous cycles.","Fluoxetine,Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors,Antidepressive Agents,Estrogens","Agricultural pesticide,Endocrine disrupting chemicals,Precocious puberty",
31690802,-78,,,Bisphenol S and Bisphenol A disrupt morphogenesis of MCF-12A human mammary epithelial cells.,"Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers diagnosed in women worldwide. Genetic predisposition, such as breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) mutations, account for a minor percentage of the total breast cancer incidences. And thus, many life style factors have also been linked to the disease such as smoking, alcohol consumption and obesity. Emerging studies show that environmental pollutants may also play a role. Bisphenol-A (BPA) has been suspected to contribute to breast cancer development, and has been shown to affect mammary gland development amongst other effects. This prompted its replacement with other bisphenol analogs such as, bisphenol-S (BPS). In this study we used the human mammary epithelial cells, MCF-12A, grown in extracellular matrix to investigate the ability of BPA and BPS to disrupt mammary epithelial cells organization. We show that both BPA and BPS were equipotent in disrupting the organization of the acinar structures, despite BPS being less oestrogenic by other assays. Further, treatment with both compounds enabled the cells to invade the lumen of the structures. This study shows that BPS and BPA are environmental pollutants that may affect mammary development and may contribute to the development of breast cancer.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Environmental Pollutants,Phenols,Sulfones,bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)sulfone,bisphenol A","PFAS,diabetes,hyperglycemia,insulin resistance,perfluoroalkyl substances",

It is widely used in plastic products and is a potential endocrine disruptor. However, the effects of DIDP on fetal testicular cell development remain unclear. The objective of the present study was to determine the effects of DIDP on fetal testis development in rats after in utero exposure. Sprague Dawley dams were randomly divided into 5 groups and were daily gavaged with DIDP (0, 10, 100, 500, and 1000 mg/kg body weight) from gestational day 14-21. Serum testosterone levels, fetal Leydig cell number and distribution, testicular gene and protein expression in male pups were examined. DIDP decreased serum testosterone levels at 1000 mg/kg (1.37 ¬± 0.40 ng/mL, mean ¬± SE) when compared to the control level (3.14 ¬± 0.60 ng/mL). DIDP did not affect numbers of Leydig and Sertoli cells. DIDP significantly induced abnormal aggregation of fetal Leydig cells and increased the incidence of multinucleated gonocytes at 1000 mg/kg. Furthermore, DIDP down-regulated expression of Star, Cyp11a1, Hsd17b3, and Insl3 in fetal Leydig cells at 1000 mg/kg and Sox9 in Sertoli cells at 1000 mg/kg. In conclusion, the current study indicates that in utero exposure to high-dose DIDP disrupts the development of fetal testicular cells, thus affecting the male reproductive system.",,"ADHD,acute stress response,affective lability,allostasis,anxiety,cortisol,cytokines,emotion dysregulation,inflammation,stress",

Adult Siberian hamsters administered 2 or 100 microg TCDD/kg body weight/0.2 ml sesame oil had a delayed latency to first litter and an increased adult mortality compared to hamsters given 0.1 microg/kg or vehicle. Within 75 days of TCDD treatment, full reproductive capabilities were achieved. Moreover, the nocturnal melatonin rhythm was not disrupted in adults administered TCDD or in their progeny. Lymphocyte activity varied with respect to time of day and treatment. Lymphocyte proliferation was enhanced at night irrespective of TCDD treatment; during the day, 2 wk after the 2-microg/kg treatment, blastogenesis was reduced compared to that in the 0.1-microg/kg group or in vehicle-treated controls. In contrast, TCDD did not affect the mixed lymphocyte reaction in response to allogeneic antigen when assessed at 2 and 20 wk post-treatment. Thus, findings indicate that TCDD produced acute effects on fertility, mortality, and systemic lymphocyte proliferation, but long-lasting effects on specific aspects of reproductive, neuroendocrine, and immune cell functions were not observed.","Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins,Melatonin","Dio1,Dio2,Dio3,Leydig cell,Mct8,Sertoli cell,Thra,Thrb,ovary,testis,thyroid hormone,thyroid hormone deiodinase,thyroid hormone receptor,thyroid hormone transporter",

Using a rat model, we have previously shown that perinatal exposure to an environmentally relevant phthalate mixture at low doses results in cognitive flexibility deficits in adults and a reduction in neuron and synapse number within the medial prefrontal cortex. Here, we further examined the behavioral effects of exposure to an environmentally relevant mixture of phthalates at low doses during either perinatal development or adolescence. Using the elevated plus maze, adult females, not males, exposed to phthalates during adolescence showed indications of reduced anxiety-like behavior while perinatal exposed animals were unaffected. There was no effect of adolescent phthalate exposure on cognitive flexibility using the attentional set shift paradigm in either sex, unlike the impairments we have previously reported following perinatal exposure (Kougias et al., 2018b). Finally, there was no effect of phthalate exposure during either time frame on sensorimotor gating measured using prepulse inhibition. Environmentally relevant phthalate exposure during the perinatal period or during adolescence did not induce widespread changes in the adult behaviors measured here.","Endocrine Disruptors,Phthalic Acids,phthalic acid","Endocrine disruptor,Japanese turtle,Petroleum hydrocarbon,Quantitative-PCR,Xenobiotic",

Due to the new restrictions on its use, it is gradually being replaced by derived molecules, such as bisphenol F or S (BPF or BPS), whose health risks have not yet been adequately studied. In the present work, significant relationships between the new BPA substitute molecules and renal and cardiovascular diseases have been detected by performing binomial and multinomial logistic regressions in one of the world's largest cohorts of urinary phenols. The results have shown a significant relationship between urinary BPF and renal function or heart disease (specifically congestive heart failure). Urinary BPS has shown a positive relationship with the risk of hypertension and a negative relationship with kidney disease.

In this study we examined the influence of TCDD on HSCs enriched for CD34(-), c-kit(+), Sca-1(+), lineage negative (CD34-KSL) cells. The number of the CD34-KSL cells was found to be increased about four-fold upon a single oral administration of TCDD (40 micro g/kg body weight). Surprisingly, we found that these TCDD-treated cells almost lost long-term reconstitution activity. This defect was not present in AhR(-/-) mice. These findings suggest that modulation of AhR/ARNT system activity may have an effect on HSC function or survival.","Antigens, CD34,Environmental Pollutants,Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins,Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon","cyclodextrin-based adsorbents,dyes,heavy metals,organic pollutants,water pollution",

On this basis, the impact of 40-days unique oral administration of the food dye tartrazine (7.5, 27, and 47 mg/kg BW doses) was evaluated on some sexual maturation parameters on immature female Wistar rats. Vaginal opening was evaluated during the treatment period. At the end of the treatments, animals were sacrificed (estrus phase) and the relative weight of reproductive organs, pituitary gonadotrophin and sexual steroids level, cholesterol level in ovaries and folliculogenesis were evaluated. Compared to the control group, animals receiving tartrazine (47 mg/kg BW) showed significantly high percentage of early vaginal opening from day 45 of age, and an increase in the number of totals, primaries, secondaries, and antral follicles; a significant increase in serum estrogen, LH and in uterine epithelial thickness. Our findings suggest that tartrazine considerably disturbs the normal courses of puberty.

Reversal of the hyperglycemia after discontinuing treatment with HMM occurred in some rats receiving 20 mg/kg/day, whereas the effects of higher doses were still present following a 2-month recovery period. Microscopically, there were hydropic degeneration of renal tubular epithelium and vacuolation of pancreatic beta cells. Ultrastructurally, vesiculation of the Golgi-smooth membrane reticular complex and a marked reduction in the number of insulin granules were observed. It appeared that HMM exerted a disruptive effect on the production of insulin at or prior to the level of the Golgi complex. The severity and time course of morphologic changes and hyperglycemia were dependent on dose and duration of treatment.","Blood Glucose,Triazines,Altretamine","endocrine disrupting chemicals,environmental regulations,threshold,toxicology",

The xenoestrogen Bisphenol A (BPA) that is found in various consumer products has been involved in the dysregulation of numerous signalling pathways. In this paper, we present the analysis of a set of 94 genes that have been shown to be dysregulated in presence of BPA in ovarian cancer cell lines since we hypothesised that these genes might be of biomarker potential. This study sought to identify biomarkers of disease and biomarkers of disease-associated exposure. In silico analyses took place using gene expression data extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) databases. Differential expression was further validated at protein level using immunohistochemistry on an ovarian cancer tissue microarray. We found that 14 out of 94 genes are solely dysregulated in the presence of BPA, while the remaining 80 genes are already dysregulated (-value < 0.05) in their expression pattern as a consequence of the disease. We also found that seven genes have prognostic power for the overall survival in OC in relation to their expression levels. Out of these seven genes, Keratin 4 (KRT4) appears to be a biomarker of exposure-associated ovarian cancer, whereas Guanylate Binding Protein 5 (GBP5), long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 707 (LINC00707) and Solute Carrier Family 4 Member 11 (SLC4A11) are biomarkers of disease. BPA can exert a plethora of effects that can be tissue- or cancer-specific. Our in silico findings generate a hypothesis around biomarkers of disease and exposure that could potentially inform regulation and policy making.'}",,,

Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) has been widely used in industry and the exposing possibility to adult is high. In this study, DEHP was treated (133 Œºg/L and 1,330 Œºg/L in drinking water) according to the OECD test guideline 443 to mature female mice and their adrenal gland were examined for histological characteristics and steroidogenic gene expression. The wet weight of the adrenal gland was increased in all administrated groups compared to control. The diameter of zona fasciculata (ZF) was increased by DEHP in both outer ZF and inner ZF but there was no difference in morphology of the cells and arrangements into zona between groups. In addition, the arrangement of extracellular matrix was not different between control and DEHP groups. CYP11B1 was mainly localized at ZF and the intensity was not different between groups. DAX1 was localized in zona glomerulosa (ZG) and ZF, and its expression levels were decreased by DEHP administration. Its level was lower in DEHP133 group than DEHP1330 group. On the other hand, CYP17A1 was localized in ZG of DEHP1330 group. These results suggest that chronic low-dose DEHP exposing may modify the microstructure and function of the adrenal cortical cortex.",,"Bisphenol F,Bisphenol S,cardiovascular diseases,maternal-fetal exposure,transgenerational transfer",

However, consequences of prepubertal BaP exposure and its impacts on adult life are yet unknown. This study investigated the effects of BaP exposure from the juvenile period to peripubertal on reproductive parameters in adult male rats. Males were exposed to 0; 0.1; 1 or 10¬†Œºg/kg/day of BaP from post-natal (PND) 23 to PND 53 (by gavage). The lowest dose of BaP was able to compromise the male copulatory behavior, as evidenced by the delay in the first mount, intromission and ejaculation. Furthermore, BaP-treated groups showed lower sperm quality (disrupted motility and morphology) and quantity, reduced relative weights of the thyroid and seminal gland. Serum testosterone levels and the Leydig cells nuclei volume were decreased by BaP exposure whereas the StAR expression was increased. Histopathological changes in the testis also were detected in the males exposed to BaP. These results showed that prepubertal BaP-exposure adversely influenced the male reproductive system in the adult life, indicating that a comprehensive risk assessment of BaP-exposure on prepubertal period is necessary.","Endocrine Disruptors,Benzo(a)pyrene","Cell differentiation,Concanavalin A,Development,Developmental biology,Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane,Endocrine disrupter,Immune system,Immunology,Proliferative response,Thymic lymphocytes,Thymus,Toxicology",

Endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) have been associated with a variety of detrimental human health effects, including respiratory issues, as a result of their ability to disrupt cell physiology. Vinclozolin ((RS)-3-(3,5-Dichlorophenyl)-5-methyl-5-vinyloxazolidine-2,4-dione) is a common dicarboximide fungicide used to treat plant diseases. Several studies have analyzed the effects of vinclozolin exposure on the reproductive system, but less is known about its effect on other organs such as the lung. Mice were exposed for 28 days to orally administered vinclozolin at a dose of 100 mg/kg. Vinclozolin exposure induced histological alterations and collagen depositions in the lung. Additionally, vinclozolin induced inflammation and oxidative stress that led to lung apoptosis. Our study demonstrates for the first time that the toxicological effects of vinclozolin are not limited to the reproductive system but also involve other organs such as the lung.","Endocrine Disruptors,Fungicides, Industrial,NF-E2-Related Factor 2,NF-kappa B,Oxazoles,vinclozolin","Advanced oxidation processes,Photocatalyst,Photodegradation,Phthalate esters,Pollutant removal",

NP is widely found in sewage and sludge, which has neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity, metabolic toxicity and reproductive toxicity. In this study, we investigated the effects of NP exposure on mammalian oocyte quality from organelle aspects with mouse in vivo model. The results showed that the ovarian weight of mice exposed to 500¬†Œºg/L NP for 4 weeks increased and the development ability of oocytes decreased, showing with lower rate of polar body extrusion. Further analysis indicated that exposure to NP caused the abnormal distribution of mitochondria, following with altered membrane potential drop. NP exposure disrupted the spindle periphery localization of ER, and affected the expression of GRP78 for the induction of ER stress. Moreover, Golgi apparatus fragment in the oocytes was observed, and Rab11-based vesicle transport was disturbed. We also found that the protein degradation might be affected since LAMP2 expression increased and LC3 decreased, indicating the lysosome and autophagy dysfunction. Taken together, our findings suggested that the exposure of NP to mice in vivo affected oocyte quality through its effects on the distribution and function of organelles.",,,
33937452,-76,,,Dataset of testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) risk associated with serum polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) by age at diagnosis and histologic types.,"In a population-based case control study of testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT), we reported a strong positive association between serum levels of Wolff's Group 1 (potentially estrogenic) polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs) and risk of TGCT, and the observed associations were similar for both seminoma and non-seminoma. While the observed specific associations between TGCT and Wolff's Group 1 PCBs cannot be easily explained by bias or confounding, a question can still be asked, that is, could the relationship between PCBs and TGCT differ by age at diagnosis? PCBs tend to bioaccumulate, with more heavily chlorinated PCB congeners tending to have longer half-lives. Half-lives of PCB congeners were reported ranging from 4.6 years for PCB-28 to 41.0 years for PCB-156. The half-life for the heavy PCB congeners (17.8 years) was found to be approximately twice that for the light PCBs (9.6 years) in early studies. Therefore, the same PCB concentration measured in a 20-year-old vs. a 55-year-old is unlikely to represent the same lifetime PCB exposure or type of PCB exposure. In this analysis, we stratified the data by median age of diagnosis of TGCT and further stratified by histologic type of TGCT (seminoma vs non-seminoma) to explore if the risk of TGCT associated with PCB exposures differs by age.",,"circadian misalignment,clock genes,insulin resistance,machinery,occupational and environmental factors,sleep disturbances,thyroid cancer",

Octylmethoxycinnamate (OMC) is the most widely used UV-B filter and as EDC interacts with TH receptors. However, their effects on thyroid diseases during pregnancy remain unknown. The purpose of this work was to assess the short- and long-term effects of OMC on arterial tonus of pregnant women with hypothyroidism. To elucidate this, human umbilical artery (HUA) rings without endothelium were used to explore the vascular effects of OMC by arterial and cellular experiments. The binding energy and the modes of interaction of the OMC into the active center of the TSHR and THRŒ± were analyzed by molecular docking studies. Our results indicated that OMC altered the contractility patterns of HUA contracted with serotonin, histamine and KCl, possibly due to an interference with serotonin and histamine receptors or an involvement of the Ca channels. The molecular docking analysis show that OMC compete with T for the binding center of THRŒ±.

It is also an analog of bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine disrupting chemical identified by the Endocrine Society. As such, TBBPA needs to be investigated for similar potential human health risks. Using rats as a model, we exposed pregnant dams and their progeny to 0, 0.1, 25, or 250 mg TBBPA/kg of body weight until the offspring reached adulthood and assessed the first generation of males for any reproductive tract abnormalities. We found no differences in the morphology of testes, sperm, prostates, or secondary sex organs from post-natal day 21 through one-year of age. A delay in the time to preputial separation was found with the 250 mg/kg treatment. Also, minor differences of sperm count at one-year old with the 25 mg/kg treatment and expression levels of two steroidogenic pathway enzymes at either post-natal day 90 or one-year old in the 250 mg/kg treatment group were detected, but spermatogenesis was not disrupted. While these results may lead to the supposition that TBBPA is less harmful than its parent compound BPA, more studies need to be conducted to assess long-term exposure effects.","Flame Retardants,Polybrominated Biphenyls,tetrabromobisphenol A","EDCs,Leydig cells,Sertoli cells,male infertility,metabolic changes detection,obesogens,peritubular myoid cells,pesticides,pesticides detection,spermatogenesis,testicular metabolism",

So far, little attention has been attributed to the fact that humans are typically not exposed to isolated compounds, but to mixtures which for example might comprise in addition to hop flavonoids further xenoestrogens, e.g., certain pesticides used for plant protection of hops and barley. Thus, we used the alkaline phosphatase assay to assess combinatory estrogenic effects of three signature compounds - xanthohumol, 8-prenylnaringenin and iso-xanthohumol-on Ishikawa cells in a combination that resembled the concentration ratios observable in beer. Moreover, we added this natural flavonoid pattern to a mixture of representative estrogenic pesticides to assess their combined effects. Using state-of-the-art statistical tools, we observed cumulative to slightly synergistic effects between isolated flavonoids as well as the flavonoid and the pesticide mixture. Of potential importance, these effects were found at low nanomolar hop polyphenol concentrations that one can reasonably expect to occur  after the consumption of strongly hopped beer.

35796699,-75,,,The consequence and mechanism of dietary flavonoids on androgen profiles and disorders amelioration.,"Androgen is a kind of steroid hormone that plays a vital role in reproductive system and homeostasis of the body. Disrupted androgen balance serves as the causal contributor to a series of physiological disorders and even diseases. Flavonoids, as an extremely frequent family of natural polyphenols, exist widely in plants and foods and have received great attention when considering their inevitable consumption and estrogen-like effects. Mounting evidence illustrates that flavonoids have a propensity to interfere with androgen synthesis and metabolism, and also have a designated improvement effect on androgen disorders. Therefore, flavonoids were divided into six subclasses based on the structural feature in this paper, and the literature about their effects on androgens published in the past ten years was summarized. It could be concluded that flavonoids have the potential to regulate androgen levels and biological effects, mainly by interfering with the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, androgen synthesis and metabolism, androgen binding with its receptors and membrane receptors, and antioxidant effects. The faced challenges about androgen regulation by flavonoids masterly include target mechanism exploration, individual heterogeneity, food matrixes interaction, and lack of clinical study.

Expression of transcriptional factor Oct4 by reticularis cells was down-regulated indicating their diminished proliferative potency. No significant alterations in Sonic Hedgehog expression were observed. Thus, DDT-provoked disorders of transcriptional regulation result in abnormal development of zona reticularis thereby disturbing sexual maturation in males.","Endocrine Disruptors,DDT","Hippo,LATS1/2,Mst1/2,YAP,development,pancreas",

From the results of individual chemicals, the activity of binary/ternary mixture prepared from the agonists for the ER transcription activity was measured, and compared to the predicted values obtained by the full logistic model. The measured and the predicted values were found to be very similar. This study may suggest that prediction of mixture activity by proper models would be one of the supportive tools for the risk assessment and sound regulation of chemical mixtures which have potential endocrine disrupting effects in consumer products.","Cosmetics,Endocrine Disruptors,Parabens,Receptors, Androgen,Receptors, Estrogen","Colgate Total¬Æ,TCS,antimicrobials,endocrine disrupting chemicals,personal care products,toxicity,triclosan",

Among OCPs, Œ≤-hexachlorocyclohexane (Œ≤-HCH) is one of the most widespread and, at the same time, poorly studied environmental contaminant. Due to its physicochemical properties, Œ≤-HCH is the most hazardous of all HCH isomers; therefore, clarifying the mechanisms underlying its molecular action could provide further elements to draw the biochemical profile of this OCP. For this purpose, LNCaP and HepG2 cell lines were used as models and were subjected to immunoblot, immunofluorescence, and RT-qPCR analysis to follow the expression and mRNA levels, together with the distribution, of key biomolecules involved in the intracellular responses to Œ≤-HCH. In parallel, variations in redox homeostasis and cellular bioenergetic profile were monitored to have a complete overview of Œ≤-HCH effects. Obtained results strongly support the hypothesis that Œ≤-HCH could be an endocrine disrupting chemical as well as an activator of AhR signaling, promoting the establishment of an oxidative stress condition and a cellular metabolic shift toward aerobic glycolysis.

Previous studies on Cd-induced damage to male fertility mainly focus on the structure and function of testis, including cytoskeleton, blood-testis barrier, and steroidogenesis. Nevertheless, to date, no studies have investigated the effects of Cd exposure on sperm epigenetic inheritance and intergenerational inheritance. In our study, we systematically revealed the changes in sperm tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNA) profiles and found that 14 tsRNAs (9 up-regulated and 5 down-regulated) were significantly altered after Cd exposure. Bioinformatics of tsRNA-mRNA-pathway interactions revealed that the altered biological functions mainly were related to ion transmembrane transport, lipid metabolism and cell membrane system. In addition, we focused on two stages of early embryo development and selected two organs to study the impact of these changes on cell membrane system, especially mitochondrion and lysosome, two typical membrane-enclosed organelles. Surprisingly, we found that the content of mitochondrion was significantly decreased in 2-cell stage, whereas remarkably increased in the morula stage.

Animals of both experimental groups received bisphenol A and triclosan (homogeneity>97%) in a dose of 200 mg/kg daily for 2 months with food. The concentrations of disruptors were measured directly in the testicular tissue by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In both experimental groups, the concentrations of bisphenol A and triclosan in the testicular tissue significantly differed from the control (intact animals). Animals exposed to bisphenol A significantly differed by sperm parameters (total number, motility, and sperm morphology) from control rats. Animals receiving triclosan significantly differed from control rats only by the number of actively motile spermatozoa and the weight of the testicles.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Phenols,Triclosan,bisphenol A","cognition,cortisol,emotion,inflammation,neurobehavioral functioning,sleep deprivation",

By using primary cortical neuron cultures, we found that OP-treated showed a decreased length of axons and dendrites and an increased number of primary and secondary dendrites. OP reduced bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), mitotic marker Ki67, and phospho-histone H3 (p-Histone-H3), resulting in a reduction of neuronal progenitor proliferation in offspring mouse brain. Moreover, OP induced apoptosis in neuronal progenitor cells in offspring mouse brain. Furthermore, offspring mice from OP-treated dams showed abnormal cognitive, social, and anxiety-like behaviors. Taken together, these results suggest that perinatal exposure to OP disrupts brain development and behavior in mice.","Endocrine Disruptors,Phenols,Receptors, Estrogen,Surface-Active Agents,4-tert-octylphenol","Benchmark dose approach,Toxic metals,endocrine disruptors,reproductive hormones",

In our study, we studied transactional exposure to bisphenol and its effects on newborn male mice throughout their reproductive life. Newborn male mice were exposed to bisphenol S and bisphenol F through maternal milk from post-natal day 0 to post-natal day 15 at concentrations of 0.1 ng.g/bw/day and 10 ng.g/bw/day, respectively. Although there were minimal differences between the control and experimental groups in testicular tissue quality and spermatozoa quality, we discovered an interesting influence on early embryonic development. Moderate doses of bisphenol negatively affected cleavage of the early embryo and subsequently, the blastocyst rate, as well as the number of blastomeres per blastocyst. In our study, we focused on correlations between particular stages from spermatogenesis to blastocyst development. We followed epigenetic changes such as dimethylation of histone H3 and phosphorylation of histone H2 from germ cells to blastocysts; we discovered the transfer of DNA double-strand breaks through the paternal pronucleus from spermatozoa to blastomeres in the blastocyst. We elucidated the impact of sperm DNA damage on early embryonic development, and our results indicate that idiopathic infertility in adulthood may have causes related to the perinatal period.",,"XXY (aneuploidy of klinefelter syndrome),case report,congenital adrenal hyperplasia,klinefelter syndrome,neurodevelopment",

In our laboratory we previously found that perinatal BPA exposure results in a higher number of neurons in the adult male rat prefrontal cortex (PFC) and less play in adolescents of both sexes. Here we examine changes in the rate of postnatal apoptosis in the rat prefrontal cortex and its timing with brief BPA exposure. Because an increased number of neurons in the PFC is a characteristic of a subtype of autism spectrum disorder, we tested social preference following brief BPA exposure and also expression of a small group of genes. Males and females were exposed to BPA from postnatal days (P) 6 through 8 or from P10 through 12. Both exposures significantly decreased indicators of cell death in the developing medial prefrontal cortex in male subjects only. Additionally, males exposed to BPA from P6 - 8 showed decreased social preference and decreased cortical expression of Shank3 and Homer1, two synaptic scaffolding genes that have been implicated in social deficits. There were no significant effects of BPA in the female subjects.

The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between BPA exposure and thyroid function. We obtained survey data and blood samples from The Thai National Health Examination Survey IV 2009, a nationally representative cross-sectional survey using a multistage, stratified sampling of the Thai population. A total of 2,340 subjects aged 18-94 years were sampled for the present study. Serum BPA, TSH, FT4, and related covariates were measured. BPA was log-transformed prior to analysis. BPA was detected in 52.8 % of serum samples with a median concentration of 0.33 (range 0-66.91) ng/mL. We excluded subjects who tested positive for thyroid autoantibody and then stratified the remaining subjects by gender; the analysis showed a significantly negative correlation between serum BPA and FT4 levels in males (r = -0.14, P < 0.001). In contrast, no association was observed in females. BPA was not associated with TSH in either gender. This gender-related discrepancy is possibly related to androgen-related differences in the metabolism of BPA. Our preliminary results provide evidence of a negative association between BPA and FT4 levels.

Among others, diethyl phthalate (DEP) is largely used in products for infants, children, and adults, in which its exposure has been correlated with an increased risk of breast cancer. The adverse health outcomes deriving from phthalate exposure have been associated with their activity as endocrine disruptors (EDCs) of the steroid and thyroid hormone signaling by affecting developmental and reproductive health, and even carcinogenicity. However, the estrogen disruptor activities of DEP are still controversial, and the mechanism at the root of the estrogenic-disrupting action of DEP remains to be clarified. Here, we evaluated the DEP mechanism of action on the activation status of estrogen receptor Œ± (ERŒ±) by analyzing the receptor's phosphorylation as well as both nuclear and extra-nuclear pathways triggered by the receptor to modulate the proliferation of breast cancer cells. Although DEP does not bind to ERŒ±, our results suggest that this phthalate ester exerts multiple parallel interactions with ERŒ± signaling and emphasize the importance to determine an appropriate battery of in vitro methods that will include specific molecular mechanisms involved in the endocrine disruption.",,"Malnutrition,energy balance,fecal microbiota transplantation,microbiota,prebiotics,probiotics,short-chain fatty acids",

Yet, how BPA induces these disorders and whether its effects are long lasting are largely unknown. In this study, using a mouse model, we demonstrated that in utero exposure to an environmentally relevant dose of BPA induced locomotor deficits, anxiety-like behavior, and declarative memory impairments that persisted into old age (18 months). Compared to the control animals, the BPA-exposed mice had a significant decrease in locomotor activity, exploratory tendencies, and long-term memory, and an increase in anxiety. The global brain gene expression profile was altered permanently by BPA treatment and showed regional and sexual differences. The BPA-treated male mice had more changes in the hippocampus, while female mice experienced more changes in the cortex. Overall, we demonstrate that in utero exposure to BPA induces permanent changes in brain gene expression in a region-specific and sex-specific manner, including a significant decrease in locomotor activity, learning ability, long-term memory, and an increase in anxiety. Fetal/early life exposures permanently affect neurobehavioral functions that deteriorate with age; BPA exposure may compound the effects of aging.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Estrogens, Non-Steroidal,Phenols,bisphenol A","Benzaldehyde,Bisphenol A,DFT,Degradation,PACN",

Dibutyltin and diphenyltin, metabolites of TBT and TPT, respectively, also promoted HAT activity, but monobutyltin, monophenyltin, and inorganic tin had no effect. Further, TBT and TPT enhanced HAT activity when nucleosomal histones were used as substrates.

Cox regression and linear models were used to determine associations between maternal phthalate levels and age at menarche, change in height and weight z-scores between birth and two years, height from birth to 20 years, BMI from two to 20 years, deviation from mid-parental height at age 20 and DEXA scan measures at age 20. Weak negative associations were detected with some phthalate metabolites and change in height and weight z-score during infancy. Weak positive associations between some of the high molecular weight phthalate metabolites and height z-score were detected during childhood. While still within the normal range, age at menarche was slightly delayed in girls with higher prenatal exposure to the higher molecular weight phthalate metabolites. We derived some associations between prenatal phthalate exposure with early growth patterns and age at menarche.","Environmental Pollutants,Phthalic Acids,phthalic acid","Aflatoxin B1,Edible vegetable oil,Endocrine disruptor,Enterohepatic diseases,Zearalenone",

However, it is not yet known how they are related to urticaria. We investigated the association between phthalate exposure and urticaria in 10 healthy controls and 20 adult patients with active urticaria. The urinary levels of mono--butyl phthalate (MnBP), mono-2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl phthalate (MECPP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate, and mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP) were measured by using high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, and mast cell releasability was determined after phthalate treatment. The levels of phthalate metabolites, especially di-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), are significantly increased in the urine of patients with urticaria compared to the healthy controls. The release of Œ≤-hexosaminidase in human mast cells is more significantly increased by MnBP, mono-benzyl phthalate, MEHHP, and MECPP compared to the negative controls; interestingly, the highest secretion of Œ≤-hexosaminidase is observed after the lowest stimulation of MECPP.

In this study, we further explored the relationship between exposure to these metals and prevalent breast cancer among female participants, aged 20¬†years or older, in the 2007-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Exposure was determined by measuring urinary concentrations of metals using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Urine creatinine-corrected concentrations of metals were calculated for each study participant. Multivariate logistic regression models were constructed to examine the association between urinary metals and prevalent breast cancer, adjusting for potential confounders. Of the 3352 study participants, 106 had been diagnosed with breast cancer (weighted prevalence, 3.13%). The results show that women with breast cancer had significantly higher urinary concentrations of lead and cadmium (both p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.0001) than those without breast cancer. After adjusting for all the covariates included in the study, however, only urinary lead was shown to be significantly associated with increased prevalence of breast cancer, with an odds ratio of 2.95 (95% CI: 1.13, 7.70) in the highest quartile of urinary lead concentrations (‚â•‚Äâ0.71¬†¬µg/g creatinine) as compared with the lowest quartile. No statistically significant associations were observed between urine cadmium or mercury levels and breast cancer.

There is a critical period of vulnerability to NP during male reproductive development in the neonatal stage. Changes were found when NPs were given to male pups before 13 d of age, but not when given at > or =13 d of age. NP acts on the male reproductive tissues through the estrogen receptor (ER), since concomitant treatment with ICI 182,780, a specific ER antagonist, blocked NP's effects on the testis and male accessory organs. NP-treated males in the neonatal period had greatly reduced their subsequent capacity to impregnate young fertile females. Our results suggest that exposure of neonatal male rats to NP is potentially deleterious to their reproductive development and affects their reproductive performance.","Estrogens,Phenols,nonylphenol",,

The aim of the present in vitro study was to evaluate the potential impact bisphenols A, B, S and F on the cell viability and testosterone release in TM3 Leydig cell line. Mice Leydig cells were cultured in the presence of different concentrations of bisphenols (0.04-50 ¬µg.ml-1) during 24 h exposure. Quantification of the cell viability was assessed using the metabolic activity assay, while the level of testosterone in cell culture media was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Within the panel of substances under investigations, the higher experimental concentrations (10; 25 and 50 ¬µg.ml-1) significantly (P<0.001) decreased Leydig cells viability, while the same doses of BPA and BPB also reduced testosterone production significantly (P<0.001). Taken together, the results of our study reported herein is a consistent whit the conclusion that higher experimental doses of bisphenols have a cytotoxic effect and could have a dose-dependent impact on testosterone production.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Estrogens, Non-Steroidal,Phenols,bisphenol B,Testosterone,bisphenol A","endocrine disruption,environmental contamination,noncarcinogenic and carcinogenic risk,outliers,risk quotient (RQ)",

PFOS is known to cause damage to renal cells; however, studies of PFOS-induced ferroptosis in cells have not been reported. We used the CCK-8 method to detect cell viability, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence methods to detect ROS levels and Western blot to detect ferroptosis, endoplasmic reticulum stress, antioxidant and apoptosis-related proteins. In our study, we found that PFOS could induce the onset of ferroptosis in HK-2 cells with decreased GPx4 expression and elevated ACSL4 and FTH1 expression, which are hallmarks for the development of ferroptosis. In addition, PFOS-induced ferroptosis in HK-2 cells could be reversed by Fer-1. We also found that endoplasmic reticulum stress and its mediated apoptotic mechanism and P53-mediated antioxidant mechanism are involved in the toxic damage of cells by PFOS. In this paper, we demonstrated for the first time that PFOS can induce ferroptosis in HK-2 cells. In addition, we preliminarily explored other mechanisms of cytotoxic damage by PFOS, which provides a new idea to study the toxicity of PFOS as well as the damage to the kidney and its mechanism.",,"BBP,HFD,SREBP1,diabetes,hepatic lipid synthesis,obesity",

34141151,-69,,,Promotion effects of DEHP on hepatocellular carcinoma models: up-regulation of PD-L1 by activating the JAK2/STAT3 pathway.,"Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), as an endocrine disruptor, is often used as a plasticizer in various polyvinyl chloride plastic products and medical consumables. Epidemiological studies have shown that long-term large intake of DEHP may be a risk factor for liver dysfunction. Long-term exposure to DEHP is associated with liver disease and aggravates the progression of chronic liver injury. However, the effects of DEHP on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are rarely studied. In this study, we sought to determine the effects of DEHP on HCC induced by carbon tetrachloride combined with diethylnitrosamine, and further study its molecular mechanism. It was found that DEHP exposure significantly promotes tumor immune escape and activates signaling pathways involved in related protein expression of tumor immune escape, including PD-L1, JAK2, and STAT3. In addition, the trends observed in the HepG2 cells assay are consistent with vivo conditions. In summary, DEHP may play a tumor-promoting role in HCC mice and IFN-Œ≥ stimulated HepG2 cells, which may be related to the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.",,"Ceramic membrane,Emerging organic contaminants,Odorous compounds,Ozonation,Secondary effluent",

We studied the release of four hormones and the activation of P2X7 receptor in JEG-Tox human placental cells as key biomarkers for endocrine toxicity. We observed that niaouli, orange, tea tree, wintergreen and ylang-ylang EOs and their key components disrupted at least one of the studied hormones but none of them activated the P2X7 cell death receptor. The tested EOs appear then to be more hormonal modulators rather than EDCs in human placental cells. The hormonal effects observed with the key components were very different from those observed with the EOs.

About 0.1, 1, and 10 ŒºM BPA did not significantly affect the viability of KGN while 100‚ÄâŒºM of BPA caused a statistically significant decrease in the viability of KGN. Treatment KGN with 10 ŒºM BPA resulted in a significant decrease in progesterone biosynthesis. The treatment also significantly increased the expression of ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1) and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR). In the current study, exposure to BPA could lead to decreased progesterone production probably through the upregulation of ABCA1 in human granulosa cells.","Benzhydryl Compounds,Phenols,Progesterone,bisphenol A","hypertension,plasticity,sleep disordered breathing,stress",

As endocrine disruptors, organophosphate esters (OPEs) causes many diseases via human exposure. However, there is limited research on the risk of OPE exposure to female-specific cancers. Blood measurements are biomarkers for chemical exposures by their definition. Thus, in the present study, 11 OPEs were analyzed in the plasma of patients with 4 female-specific tumors. 2-Ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (EHDPP) was detected at the highest levels in all groups. The Spearman correlation test results showed significantly positive correlations between some OPEs in each group, which indicated that those OPEs had similar sources and/or behaved similarly in the patients of each group. However, compared with different patient groups, obvious differences in the correlation results were noted, implying the differences in the metabolism of OPEs between different groups. The results of the correlation analysis showed that EHDPP concentration was associated with the risk of breast cancer (p¬†<¬†0.05), while tri-n-butyl phosphate (TNBP), tris (methylphenyl) phosphate (TMPP), triphenyl phosphate (TPHP), and EHDPP concentrations were associated with the risk of cervical cancer (p¬†<¬†0.05 or p¬†<¬†0.01).

34771623,-67,,,Bisphenol A Alters the Energy Metabolism of Stromal Cells and Could Promote Bladder Cancer Progression.,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine-disrupting molecule used in plastics. Through its release in food and the environment, BPA can be found in humans and is mostly excreted in urine. The bladder is therefore continuously exposed to this compound. BPA can bind to multiple cell receptors involved in proliferation, migration and invasion pathways, and exposure to BPA is associated with cancer progression. Considering the physiological concentrations of BPA in urine, we tested the effect of nanomolar concentrations of BPA on the metabolism of bladder fibroblasts and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Our results show that BPA led to a decreased metabolism in fibroblasts, which could alter the extracellular matrix. Furthermore, CAF induction triggered a metabolic switch, similar to the Warburg effect described in cancer cells. Additionally, we demonstrated that nanomolar concentrations of BPA could exacerbate this metabolic switch observed in CAFs via an increased glycolytic metabolism, leading to greater acidification of the extracellular environment. These findings suggest that chronic exposure to BPA could promote cancer progression through an alteration of the metabolism of stromal cells.",,"endocrine-disrupting chemicals,environmental water samples,magnetic graphene oxide,magnetic solid-phase extraction",

Considering metalloestrogenic Cd property and a plethora of research work on hormone involvement in breast cancer the study aimed to determine Cd concentration in three compartments of breast cancer patients in relation to their blood hormone status. Further, as oxidative stress is a critical mechanism of Cd toxicity, the objective of this study was to determine potential changes in oxidative status homeostasis. The study enrolled 55 patients with breast cancer diagnosis and 41 healthy women with benign breast changes. Concentration of Cd was determined using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. Cadmium concentration in tumor tissue was significantly higher than control and almost four times higher than Cd concentration in the healthy surrounding tissue. Strong positive correlation was observed between Cd concentrations in changed breast tissue and FSH and LH levels, while the correlation was negative with estradiol level. Cancer patients had significantly increased blood total antioxidative status while total oxidative status did not significantly differ between study groups. The study revealed Cd implication in breast cancer onset following a significant odd ratio for Cd levels in changed tissue samples.

There is increasing epidemiologic evidence that abnormal maternal thyroid function during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of child ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Prenatal exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) is known to disrupt thyroid function and can affect early brain development; thus, thyroid dysfunction is hypothesized to mediate this relationship. The concept of a potential pathway from prenatal PFAS exposure through thyroid dysfunction to ASD etiology is not new; however, the extant literature on this topic is scant. The aim of this review is to evaluate and summarize reports with regard to potential mechanisms in this pathway.",,"Aryl hydrocarbon receptor,Prothioconazole,Prothioconazole-desthio,Reproductive health",
26167515,-65,,,Gestational bisphenol A exposure and testis development.,"Virtually all humans are exposed to bisphenol A (BPA). Since BPA can act as a ligand for estrogen receptors, potential hazardous effects of BPA should be evaluated in the context of endogenous estrogenic hormones. Because estrogen is metabolized in the placenta, developing fetuses are normally exposed to very low endogenous estrogen levels. BPA, on the other hand, passes through the placenta and might have distinct adverse consequences during the sensitive stages of fetal development. Testicular gametogenesis and steroidogenesis begin early during fetal development. These processes are sensitive to estrogens and play a role in determining the number of germ stem cells, sperm count, and male hormone levels in adulthood. Although studies have shown a correlation between BPA exposure and perturbed reproduction, a clear consensus has yet to be established as to whether current human gestational BPA exposure results in direct adverse effects on male genital development and reproduction. However, studies in animals and in vitro have provided direct evidence for the ability of BPA exposure to influence male reproductive development. This review discusses the current knowledge of potential effects of BPA exposure on male reproductive health and whether gestational exposure adversely affects testis development.",,"Amphibian conservation,energy budgets,environmental stress,global change,standard metabolic rate,stress physiology",

The thymus of the exposed rats did not show morphological abnormalities. Exposure to the endocrine disrupter was found to alter age-dependent changes of thymic lymphocyte proliferative activity and attenuate proliferative response to Concanavalin A in puberty and adulthood. Insufficient response to mitogen was mediated by higher content of actively proliferating Ki-67-positive lymphoblasts compared to the control values. Insufficient proliferative response to mitogen in developmentally exposed to the endocrine disruptor rats may provide higher risk of impaired cellular immune reactions.",,"Embryoid body test,Endoplasmic stress,Mouse embryonic stem cells",

In our study, we assessed the effect of exposure to bisphenol S (BPS) via breast milk on the testicular tissue health of adult male mice. Lactating dams were exposed to BPS through drinking water (0.216‚ÄØng‚ÄØg bw/day and 21.6‚ÄØng‚ÄØg bw/day) from post-natal day 0-15. Although there was no significant difference in testicular histopathology between the control and experimental groups, we observed an increase in the number of tight and gap junctions in the blood-testis barrier (BTB) of adult mice after lactation BPS exposure. Moreover, there was an increase in oxidative stress markers in adult testicular tissue of mice exposed via breast milk. Our lactation model indicates that breast milk is a route of exposure to an endocrine disruptor that can be responsible for idiopathic male infertility through the damage of the BTB and weakening of oxidative stress resistance in adulthood.","Benzhydryl Compounds,bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)sulfone,Sulfones,Endocrine Disruptors","acetamiprid,aquatic organisms,bees,birds,endocrine disruption,environmental risk assessment,expert knowledge elicitation,insecticides,neonicotinoids,soil organisms,uncertainty analysis",

In this study, we evaluated the effects of various concentrations of methylmercury (MeHg) on immortalized, non-tumorigenic thyroid cells (Nthy-ori-3-1). Exposure to MeHg at 2.5 and 5 ¬µM for 24 h caused a reduction in cell viability with a decrease of the cell population in sub-G0 phase, as detected by MTT and flow cytometry. Conversely, MeHg at the lower concentration of 0.1 ¬µM increased the cell viability with a rise of G2/M phase. An immunoblot analysis showed higher expression levels of phospho-ERK and not of phospho-Akt. Further enhancement of the cell growth rate was observed after a prolonged exposure of the cells up to 18 days to MeHg 0.1 ¬µM. The present findings demonstrate the toxicity of high concentrations of MeHg on thyroid cells, while showing that treatment with lower doses of Hg, as may occur after prolonged exposure to this environmental contaminant, exerts a promoting effect on thyroid cell proliferation, by acting on the ERK-mediated pro-oncogenic signal transduction pathway.","Endocrine Disruptors,Methylmercury Compounds","CAR-T cells,di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate,exposure,leukapheresis,medical devices,plasticizer",

Thyroxine-injected infant rats were superior to controls on active avoidance, inferior on passive avoidance, and equal on discriminated escape. Adolescent rats which had received postnatal thyroxine were inferior to controls in Lashley III maze acquisition whether or not they had received supplementary thryoxine at the time of training. These data suggest that differences in locomotor activity, rather than in learning ability, account for early behavioral effects and that changes other than endocrine disturbances account for the adult deficits.

To evaluate the urinary Cd levels associated with T2DM, we perform a benchmark dose (BMD) analysis based on data from the 1999-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Weighted datasets were generated by the inverse probability of treatment weighting analysis to develop the robustness of our analysis. We inferred a strong positive association between urinary Cd and T2DM in unweighted and weighted populations. BMD and its low limit (BMDL) estimates for 5% benchmark responses (BMR) was 0.297 (0.198) and 0.190 (0.178) Œºg/g creatinine for each population, respectively. The sensitivity analysis by race, followed by weight of sum method showed similar estimates of urinary Cd level for the risk of developing T2DM, which are rather low and far less than those for the renal or bone disease development risk.

A growing number of studies showed that DEHP could exhibit long-term adverse health effects on the human body, particularly in the liver, kidneys, heart and reproductive systems. However, the impact of oral intake of DEHP on the nervous system is extremely limited. In the present study, the adult C57BL/6J male mice were intragastrically administered with two dosages of DEHP for 35‚Äâdays. The behavioral parameters were assessed using the elevated plus maze and open-field test. The mRNA expression levels of neuropeptides and the oxidative stress-associated proteins were detected by qPCR and western blot seperately. The histopathologic alterations of the brain were observed by H&E and Nissl staining. The results demonstrated that DEHP exposure could result in neurobehavioral impairments such as locomotor increase and anxiety-like behavior. Furthermore, pathological damages were clearly observed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, accompanied by a decrease in neuropeptides and an increase in oxidative stress, which were all positively correlated with the dose of DEHP.

Hence, exposure by human populations is becoming a public health problem. With a half-life of up to 40 years, cadmium is now a topic of great interest due to its role as an endocrine disruptor and its effects on male reproduction. Cd's diverse toxic mechanisms are based on its capacity to mimic divalent ions -calcium, zinc, iron- that participate in physiological processes. It alters the mitochondrial function and generates the production of free radicals that can induce apoptosis. In male reproduction, Cd alters the precise coordination of the hypothalamic-hypophysis-testis axis (HHT), resulting in the loss of testicular functions like steroidogenesis, spermatogenesis and the onset of puberty, sexual maturity, sexual behavior and fertility. Exposure to Cd may even cause changes in the immune system that are associated with the reproductive system.

The body weight gain in treated rats was lower at both 2 and 4 weeks as compared to the control rats. The weight of liver and spleen decreased, while that of kidneys increased as compared to the control rats. Thyroid and adrenal showed increase in weight at both 2 and 4 weeks of treatments.",,"Adverse outcome pathway,Endocrine disruption,Fadrozole,Species extrapolation",
23762632,-52,,,In vitro effects of herbicides and insecticides on human breast cells.,"Numerous studies have indicated that the pesticides and herbicides used in agricultural processes in the United States and Europe may have detrimental effects upon human health. Many of these compounds have been indicated as potential endocrine and reproductive disruptors, although the studies have examined supraphysiological levels well above the US EPA safe levels for drinking water and have often examined these effects in ""model"" cell lines such as Chinese hamster ovary cells. We have now examined the cytotoxicity of more environmentally relevant concentrations of four herbicides, acetochlor, atrazine, cyanazine, and simazine, and two insecticides, chlorpyrifos and resmethrin, in three human breast cell lines. Interestingly, cytotoxicity was not observed in the estrogen-dependent MCF-7 mammary epithelial carcinoma cells; rather increases in cell viability were seen for some of the compounds at select concentrations. These results vary greatly from what was observed in the estrogen independent MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and the non-cancerous MCF-10A breast cells. This gives insight into how different tumors may respond to pesticide exposure and allows us to make more accurate conclusions about the potential cytotoxicity or, at times, stimulatory actions of these pesticides.",,"Endocrine-disrupting chemicals,epigenetics,gynecology,health disparities,non-coding RNAs,women‚Äôs health",
24795899,-51,,,Exploratory analysis of urinary metabolites of phosphorus-containing flame retardants in relation to markers of male reproductive health.,"The use of phosphorus-containing flame retardants (PFRs) has increased over the past decade. Widespread human exposure has been reported, but information on the safety or potential health risks of PFRs is lacking. We assessed the relationship between urinary concentrations of two PFR metabolites [bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BDCPP) and diphenyl phosphate (DPHP)] and semen quality, sperm motion parameters, and serum hormone levels in 33 men. BDCPP and DPHP concentrations were significantly greater in urine samples collected in the afternoon compared to those collected in the morning (p <0.05). In multivariable models, a number of statistically significant or suggestive associations were observed between the reproductive health measures and both PFR metabolites. While the study was limited by a small sample size, these results warrant further investigation in a larger study population. Additional studies on sources, pathways, and routes of PFR exposure, along with research on toxicokinetics and exposure measure utility, are also needed.",,"Bacillus,antimicrobial effect,in silico methods,in vitro methods,probiotics",
35120674,-44,,,Preliminary findings reveal that phthalate exposure is associated with both subjective and objective measures of sleep in a small population of midlife women.,"Phthalates are endocrine-disrupting chemicals that influence endogenous hormones. Few studies have examined the link between phthalates and menopause. A recent secondary analysis revealed that phthalates were associated with self-reported sleep measures in perimenopausal women. However, the associations between phthalate exposure and additional measures of sleep remain unknown. We recruited a population of 27 midlife women (aged 45-54) to study the relationship between phthalate exposure and both subjective and objective measures of sleep. Preliminary results indicate that women with higher phthalate exposure have reduced sleep quality, more frequent sleep disruptions, and more restless sleep compared to women with lower exposure.","Endocrine Disruptors,Phthalic Acids,phthalic acid","Bone Biology,Endocrinology,Osteoclast/osteoblast biology",
918353,-39,,,Effect of dietary ingestion of oxalic acid on growth and reproduction in male and female Long-Evans rats.,Male and female Long-Evans rats placed on a diet of Purina laboratory chow supplemented with 2.5 and 5.0% oxalic acid for a period of 70 days revealed decreased body weights and restricted growth rates. Ingestion of 5.0% oxalic acid depressed absolute organ weights of several visceral and endocrine tissues but enhanced the organ/body weight ratios of both male and female rats.
